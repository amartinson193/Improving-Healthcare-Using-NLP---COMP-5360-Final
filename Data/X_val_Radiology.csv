hypercholesterolemia  and htn who was admitted to vascular with toe pain  but then developed hypercarbic respiratory failure      icu course  mr    presented to his cardiologist s office with      days of increasing pain in his r foot  specifically his r second toe  his exam at the time was felt to be consistent with ischemia or cellulitis  his cardiologist referred to the hospital and he was admitted to the vascular service  he was started on iv antibiotics  kefzol and flagyl  and a wound culture grew mssa  xr showed no evidence of osteomyelitis  noninvasive vascular studies were performed as the patient was a known vasculopath and it was assumed that an intervention would need to be performed to preserve his toe  studies revealed that he had extensive plaques in the l common carotid artery  bilateral internal and external carotid arteries  as well as significant bilateral iliac  superficial femoral  and tibial disease  there was retrograde flow in the l vertebral artery indicating l subclavian steal  on    while on the vascular service  he developed nausea and vomiting while moving around for all of his studies  he was given reglan and anzemet for his nausea  as well as percocet for his toe pain  he did well until   when he began to have labored breathing and a decreased o  sat to      he was felt to be wheezing and he was given nebulizers with good effect  however  he was then found to be very tachycardic  with a lot of ectopy on telemetry  he was given iv metoprolol for his tachycardia  but overnight  again developed respiratory distress  ekg was unchanged from priors  it was decided to electively intubate him as his rr was in the   s   s and his sats were only in the low   s on a nrb  his abg at the time was             he was given   mg lasix iv and   mg iv solumedrol  but he remained in respiratory distress so he was transferred to the sicu for intubation  he was sedated and ct of his chest and head were performed to look for causes of his sob  ct of his head revealed no intracranial pathology  and the cta was negative for pe  but did reveal that he had pleural effusions  bnp was elevated at the time  so he was given additional lasix    mr    was extubated the following evening  with the hope that treatment for chf and copd would have improved his respiratory status  he did well overnight  but again developed tachypnea acutely on the morning of    associated with wheezing and hypoxia  he was given nebulizer treatments x   solumedrol  and lasix with no improvement  serial abgs at the time revealed                   post extubation                    during his distress                    post intubation   on    a tte was performed which revealed left ventricular systolic function of       which was considered to be moderately depressed with inferior akinesis and basal infero septal and infero lateral hypokinesis  an attempt was made at thoracentesis given his bilateral pleural effusions  however the ip team did not feel that they could get a good view through which to tap  an ngt was inserted and tubefeeds were started   on    the decision was made to discontinue the patient s beta blocker because of increased wheezing  the patient s cardiologist instead recommended using verapamil instead for rate control    attempt was made at his second extubation on    but again he became acutely tachypneic  tachycardic and hypertensive  with his o  sats again dropping into the   s  at this point  he was reintubated and diuresis was continued  cardiac enzymes were cycled x  and were negative  ep was consulted on   and felt that the arrhythmias he was having were consistent with episodes of mat afib  with no episodes of sustained ventricular rhythms  ep confirmed that the patient needed to be on a beta blocker  not a ccb  and brought up the issue of anticoagulation   they also recommended continuing with diuresis and attempting extubation again only after his pulmonary edema had resolved  he was also started on afterload reduction with an ace inhibitor  on    a bronchoscopy was performed for further evaluation of his copious  thick  blood tinged secretions and to see if there is an anatomical reason that mr    was unable to be weaned off the vent  bal culture results were significant for gram negative rods  raising the concern for ventilator associated pneumonia  he performed an sbt on    but developed tachypnea and tachycardia after just   hrs  he was then transferred to the micu for help with achieving stable extubation    in the micu  his antibiotics were broadened to cover for pseudomonas in his sputum  with levaquin and ceftazidime  and he was given vancomycin for gram positive cocci from his r toe  which turned out to be mssa   he was started on an ace inhibitor for improved bp control as well as standing nebulizers and steroids for treatment of his copd  an insulin gtt was added to better control his hyperglycemia  diuresis was continued and his respiratory status improved  he was able to come down to pressure support  he passed a sbt and was extubated successfully on    he was able to maintain his oxygenation with        fio  by shovel mask  he was transferred to the floor on   and by the morning of    he was down to  l by nasal cannula      pneumonia  he underwent a bal on   which grew a pansensitive pseudomonas  mr    completed an   day course of ceftazidime  along with   days of levaquin  for double coverage initially  for the treatment of pseudomonas ventilator associated pneumonia on    he continued to have a productive cough  but his oxygenation improved  he was able to maintain stable o  sats of      on  l by nc  but still was mildly hypoxemic on ra        cxr showed that he still has small residual pleural effusions that are resolving      copd  mr    likely had a copd exacerbation that contributed to his difficulty in weaning off of the ventilator  however  he was able to be changed from iv solumedrol to po prednisone on the floor  the prednisone taper was started on discharge and his steroids will be slowly tapered over two weeks  he was continued on standing albuterol and ipratroprium nebulizers as he easily became wheezy with any exertion  he was also given albuterol inhalers prn  there was some concern  as   above  that his beta blocker worsened his respiratory status  but the patient seemed to tolerate oral metoprolol without any exacerbation of his copd      leukocytosis  mr    wbc began to rise on the floor  at the same time that he began to have diarrhea  given that he was on several antibiotics at the time  there was concern for c diff infection  stool studies were sent x  and were negative for c diff  he was started on flagyl for empiric treatment of c  diff and cultures were followed  id was consulted for advice in the length of treatment for his pseudomonas pneumonia  as well as advise for the treatment of his r toe  id felt that his ceftazidime could be discontinued after   days  that levofloxacin was no longer needed for double coverage  and that his r toe did not look infected  so  vancomycin could also be discontinued  ceftazidime was completed on   and per id  mr    will be continued on flagyl until    stool cultures were sent  including c diff toxin b  which was still pending upon discharge      arrhythmia  mr    was noted to have various sinus arrhythmias in the icu  possibly mat vs sinus tachycardia with ectopic beats  he was given beta blocker for his tachycardia  but in the icu  there was concern that the beta blocker was worsening his wheezing and copd  so it was discontinued  verapamil was tried instead  but mr    became very tachycardic without beta blockade  ep was consulted while the patient was in the icu and recommended discontinuing the verapamil and going back to metoprolol  which the team did with improvement in controlling his rate  on transfer to the floor  mr    was continued on telemetry and appeared to have multiple different rhythms  including mat  sinus tachycardia with ectopic beats  both ventricular and atrial  and ventricular bigeminy  he had episodes of nsvt  maximum of    beats  but remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic throughout all episodes  his attending recommended increasing the beta blockade if possible  but his blood pressure was on the lower side  so he was maintained on metoprolol   mg po tid with adequate rate control      pvd  mr    has a long history of claudication  on admission  there was concern for cellulitis vs  gangrene in his r toe   mra showed moderate to severe atherosclerotic disease  but no surgical intervention was planned during this admission due to his tenous respiratory status  mr    prefers to have the summer to heal and would like to pursue whatever intervention is necessary in the fall  dr    is aware of his decision and plans to follow him as an outpatient for now  mr    will follow up with dr        weeks after discharge      dm type ii  mr    had been on an insulin gtt in icu  with labile fingersticks    was consulted to help control his hyperglycemia in the setting of acute illness and the administration of tube feeds  on the floor  he was changed back to sc insulin  but became hypoglycemic on the recommended regimen  his steroid use for his copd exacerbation and discontinuation of tube feeds likely contributed to the lability of his glycemic control  he did have a symptomatic episode of hypoglycemia on the morning of   which quickly resolved with the administration of    amp of d    he was discharged on glipizide  mg daily  which is half of his normal home dose  as well as a humalog insulin sliding scale while he is still on prednisone  his glipizide will be titrated as needed at rehab based on his fingersticks      fen  in the icu  he had an ngt through which he was given tube feeds  on transfer to the floor  he was reevaluated by speech and swallow and passed  so he was given  a regular     heart healthy diet with thin liquids

post pericardiocentesis left sided pleural effusion status post thoracentesis readmitted with hypotension  hypoxemia  and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions     bilateral pleural effusion  left right   the patient presented with respiratory distress and was found to have a recurrence of her left sided pleural effusion leading to complete left lung collapse and hypoxemia  requiring intubation  thoracic surgery inserted a chest tube on the left and a pigtail catheter on the right which both drained serosanginous fluid  the chest tube on the right was eventually pulled after it stopped draining  the insertion of the chest tube on the left was complicated by a pneumothorax  so another chest tube was inserted on the left with a pigtail catheter  the pigtail catheter eventually stopped draining and it was subsequently pulled  a talc pleurodiesis was performed and the patient s pain was controlled with dilaudid at first and then oxycodone thereafter  her chest tubes were removed and a chest xray confirmed full expansion of the left lung with an unchanged pleural effusion  she continued to be diuresed with lasix  however  she developed a metabolic alkalosis with a respiratory acidosis  diamox was added to the lasix regimen and her bicarbonate remained level  her final chest xray shows left lower lobe atelectasis  movement and incentive spirometry were encouraged and should be continued at rehab  the patient continues to have an oxygen requirement  likely due to her atelectasis and possibly an underlying pulmonary process  she has a scheduled pulmonology followup appointment that was made at her last hospitalization  at that time  they will perform pulmonary function testing    while in the icu  the patient was started on prednisone for a post viral serositis  the prednisone was eventually discontinued after   days because the post viral serositis was unlikely in this context  analysis of the pleural fluid showed the absence of malignant cells in cytology  no bacteria viral acid fast bacteria on repeat cultures  and flow cytometry showed no cells concerning for lymphoma  the pleural effusions might be due to exacerbation of her diastolic heart failure  though on prior admissions  the effusion did not appear to be a transudate  lastly  a ct of the abdomen from   showed a cyst in the lower abdomen  a ca    was mildly elevated and a ca     was in the normal range  a pelvic u s was done to further characterize the cyst and it was noted to be a simple cyst and not concerning for malignancy     septic shock   the patient was initially hypotensive and the differential included septic shock vs  cardiogenic shock  a bedside echo in the ed did not find evidence of tamponade  so the patient most likely had septic shock with the source of infection being pulmonary  her blood pressure responded to intravenous fluids boluses  she was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics vancomycin zosyn to cover hospital acquired pneumonia and the patient improved  she completed a full course of vancomycin zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia and did not have any other signs of hemodynamic instability     acute on chronic anemia  the patient continued to have a low hematocrit with iron     l  and a slightly high ferritin  her stools were guiaic negative  the patient might have an underlying iron deficiency anemia  though it is unclear given her high ferritin  a reticulocyte count showed an appropriate reponse to her anemia  after repeated blood draws  the patient s hematocrit steadily dropped to       on    she was transfused two units of blood and tolerated it well  on discharge  her hematocrit was          acute renal failure   the patient presented with acute renal failure  which was likely prerenal azotemia given una     with treatment of her hypotension  the patient s renal failure trended towards her baseline around          with continued diuresis and the addition of lisinopril for bp management  the patient developed acute renal failure again  her diuresis was held and lisinopril discontinued  her creatinine on discharge was         urinary tract infection  the patient presented with a urinary tract infection and was treated with vanco zosyn as detailed above  she then developed yeast in her urine and her foley was removed  two days after her foley was removed  she had a leukocytosis without fever or dysruia  a urine culture revealed pan senstive pseudomonas                colonies  treatment with cipro was initiated and her leukocytosis trended downwards  no yeast remains in her urine      anxiety and depression  continue trazodone and ativan as needed  the patient was noted to be anxious during the hospitalization and would consider further therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as an outpatient     paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  on admission  the patient was on amiodarone  metoprolol and coumadin  since the patient remained in a sinus arrhythmia  not in atrial fibrillation on telemetry  throughout hospitalization  it was felt the risks of coumadin outweighed the benefits  therefore  she will not continue on coumadin  she will continue to take aspirin  metoprolol and amiodarone for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation      recurrent pericardial effusion  the pericardial effusion has also been a recurrent issue  a tte showed an effusion without hemodynamic compromise  therefore  it was treated medically  a repeat echocardiograms showed a reduced effusion     h o hyponatremia  the patient has a history of hyponatremia that has been attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate anti diuretic hormone release  her sodium remained in normal range during her time on the floors  so she will not be continued on salt tablets on discharge  in fact  she should avoid sodium since it might precipitate congestive heart failure  the possible etiology of her pleural effusions  she will have a blood draw later in the week to check her sodium  on discharge  her sodium was          swollen right arm  the patient was noted to have a swollen right arm  she had a picc line during the last hospitalization  an ultrasound ruled out a deep venous thrombosis  with diuresis  the swelling improved  so it was likely related to fluid overload      hypothyroidism  continue levoxyl     osteoporosis  continue vitamin

admitted for acute pancreatitis    the patient was seen by interventional pulomonology on arrival  who recommended a ct scan with contrast to stage the carcinoma prior to stenting  as if the patient were low stage he may be a surgical candidate rather than palliative  which is what stenting would accomplish   unfortunately  the patient has a prior history of a contrast allergy  therefore we performed the ct scan without contrast   it demonstrated a large pleural effusion on the l side  with a rim of cortex  with complete collapse of the left lung and a large hilar mass  interventional pulmonology attempted a thoracentesis  however the effusion was extremely thick and bloody  and no aspirate was obtained   he was taken to the or for rigid bronchoscopy with possible stenting on    however during the course of the procedure the patient desaturated to    percent  most likely secondary to laryngospasm  and required intubation   stenting was unable to be performed  as the lumen was completely obstructed without a patent airway distally   the patient was transfered to the micu post intubation  and remained intubated for less than    hours  being successfully extubated on the
