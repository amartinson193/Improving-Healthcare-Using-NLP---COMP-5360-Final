subsequently  an upper endoscopy with ultrasound showed severe   esophagitis and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes without abnormal esophageal thickening  she was initially treated with ambisome and

unresponsiveness was likely secondary to the   virus infection   she did not recover her mental status and remained unresponsive to painful stimuli   she did have some spontaneous movements       hypertension  initially  her antihypertensives were held in the setting of sepsis   these were restarted once she was no longer hypotensive       respiratory alkalosis  on several occasions  she had   episodes of paradoxical breathing in which an abg showed a respiratory alkalosis   there was concern for intracranial pathology  however  head ct was negative    her respiratory status subsequently improved without intervention on several occasions   however  one episode of paradoxical breathing required intubation and mechanical ventilation for   days   it was unclear the cause of the respiratory alkalosis   in retrospect  her paradoxical breathing pattern was likely secondary to the   virus infection       atrial fibrillation  she was found to have atrial fibrillation during her second period of unresponsiveness   this new atrial fibrillation was though to be related to toxic metabolic causes   her cardiac enzymes were negative   she  responded well to diltiazam for rate control   she was transitioned to lopressor for both rate control and blood pressure control       pulmonary embolism  pulmonary embolism  an echocardigram showed rv dilation   a cta at that time showed a pulmonary embolism that was thought to be from her catheter   thrombus from her right ij catheter  she was intially started on heparin  however  after further discussions with the family  it was decided that the risks of anticoagulation were not worth the benefits   therefore  the heparin was stopped       rectal bleeding  in the middle of her admission  she had isolated episode of rectal bleeding   she remained hemodynamically stable and did not have a drop in her hematocrit   however  at the end of her hospital stay  she had persistent rectal bleeding   she was transfused as needed to keep platelets and hematocrit up        fen  she was initially on neutropenic diet   once her mental status changed  she was maintained on tpn        access  she had several central lines placed and replaced during her period of persistent bacteremia        code  she was intially full code   however  once she remained unresponsive and was found to have persistent infections in the setting of neutropenia  she was transitioned to dnr dni   a family meeting was held and it was decided to continued supportive measures with antibiotics and tpn to see if her immune system could recover to counter the   virus and other infections   she did not improve and there was no indication that her counts would return   therefore  her family decided to make the goal of care comfort only   she

utilizing the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending  saphenous vein grafts to diagonal  first and second obtuse marginals  and posterior descending artery   exploratory laparotomy  liver biopsy and cholecystectomy  this    year old woman has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and diabetes  several weeks prior to admission  she reported that she has had two episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath  the first occurred while having to climb up    steps at a movie theatre during a fire drill  she describes having very severe shortness of breath and a feeling that there was no way she would make it to the top  the second episode occurred while trying to walk  to go from her parking lot to the theatre  she again described having severe shortness of breath and chest pains  resolving with relaxation  she states that she recently saw her primary care physician         who told her that her ekg looked significantly different compared to the one from several years back  she has since seen dr      in consultation and underwent stress testing that was positive for ischemia  subsequent cardiac catheterization on   revealed three vessel coronary artery disease and a reduced ejection fraction without evidence of mitral regurgitation calculated at      coronary angiography showed a codominant system  the lad showed a     stenosis of the midsegment followed by sequential     stenosis in the distal segment  accompanied by a     proximal d  stenosis  the lcx was a large  codominant vessel with an     midsegment stenosis and     om  and     om

hours  she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated  she weaned from inotropic support without difficulty and transferred to the sdu on postoperative day one  on postoperative day two  she developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and beta blockade  early on postoperative day three  she complained of right sided abdominal pain and concomitantly experienced altered mental status  initial abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable while a head ct scan found no evidence for hemorrhage  or acute major vascular territorial infarction  she rapidly declined clinically  becoming unresponsive and hypotensive with increasing oxygen requirements and decreased urine output  she emergently returned to the csru where she underwent intubation and resuscitation  monitoring lines were placed  amiodarone was discontinued  she required pressors and was profoundly acidotic with an elevated lactate  low bicarbonate and high white count  her creatinine also rose  based upon this clinical picture and strong suspicion for mesenteric ischemia  she was taken without delay to the operating room  on    an exploratory laparotomy  liver biopsy and cholecystectomy was performed by dr       operative findings were notable for severe liver and gall bladder congestion   there was no evidence of mesenteric ischemia as the large and small bowel appeared normal  liver pathology was consistent with ischemia while gall bladder findings revealed mild chronic cholecystitis  she returned to the csru for further invasive monitoring and medical management  she was kept intubated and sedated while broad spectrum antibiotics were continued  her acute renal failure was attributed to acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypoperfusion  her creatinine peaked to      the renal service was consulted  she temporarily required cvvh  a renal ultrasound was unremarkable  her urine output and hyperkalemia gradually improved with intravenous lasix and diurel  her shock liver

remained unremarkable  she concomitantly continued to experience episodes of atrial fibrillation and sinus bradycardia  several cardioversions were attempted  but unsuccessful  pronestyl and procainamide therapies were eventually started in attempts to maintain a normal sinus rhythm  she was eventually started on tube feedings for nutritional support  over several days  her clinical status improved  by postoperative day     she weaned from sedation and was re extubated without incident  she remained neurologically intact and weaned from pressor support without difficulty  her renal and liver function continued to improve  she maintained mostly a normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the       s but continued to experience paroxsymal atrial fibrillation  warfarin was eventually initiated  procain and napa levels were monitored closely and titrated accordingly while serial ecgs were obtained to assess qtc interval  tube feedings were eventually discontinued and her diet was slowly advanced as tolerated  on postoperative day     she returned to the sdu  antibiotics were empirically continued  medical therapy was optimized and warfarin was dosed for a goal inr around            she continued to work with physical therapy and make clinical improvements  due to poor iv access  a double lumen picc line was temporarily placed in her right upper arm  she was

surgery and he had lfts within normal limits at the time of discharge  per gi records the patient had a classification of child class b w      cirrhosis secondary to alcohol history  he had no appreciable ruq tenderness  jaundice  hsm on exam and he will plan to follow up with his usual pcp after discharge regarding his gi management  hepatitis b c panels were done and were all negative   the patient was noted to have had a fever at osh and he had recently completed treatment for pna  he had no dullness to percusssion on exam and he had no significant cough or productive sputum during his ccu course  at time of discharge he had wbc count of     and was afebrile  mr    did have leukocytosis to    at osh but only mildly elevated wbc to    here and cxr clear other than mild effusions

patient had a routine ua which revealed bacteria and wbcs and labs were consistent with a uti so he was started on doxycycline for a   day regimen  follow up urine cultures were negative  he was through     days therapy at time of discharge and had no complaints of dysuria or frequency   the patients magnesium and potassium were repleted on an as needed basis during his hospital stay and daily electrolytes were monitored  he was started on a full cardiac diet once he stabilized and he did very well with his oral input and had a good appetite  ivf were used sparingly in the setting of chf    sacral decubitus  the patient s sacral stage   buttock sore remained in tact and he had protective cream applied to avoid any breakdown  patient stable at time of discharge and will plan to follow up with his pcp regarding further monitoring     the patient was on anticoagulation for nstemi and thrombus coverage in the setting of his hypokinetic heart and was therefore covered for dvt prophylaxis as well  pt also helped the patient to do exercises during his stay to maintain a fair level of mobility   he was also given   mg po daily protonix for gi prophylaxis    the patient was maintained as a full code status for the entirety of his hospital stay  he was asked to please return to the emergency room or call his primary cardiologist or pcp as soon as possible if he had any

chest pain  during her hospitalization the following issues were addressed      coronary artery disease   the patient has a history of documented  vessel cad with ecg findings suggestive of panischemia  and persistant chest pain responsive to sl nitroglycerin   she was pretreated with hydration  bicarbonate  and mucomyst prior to cath for renal protection   she was brought to the cath lab and a stent was placed in the rca without complication   she subsequently developed a small hematoma on the right side   femoral ultrasound showed no pseudoaneurysm or av fistula   the hematoma stabilized in size as did her hematocrit  and no further work up was done   she continued to have chest pain during the following days  and so was brought back to the cath lab   for repeat catheterization   she had two overlapping stents placed in the proximal lad into the left main   she was monitored for another   hours  and developed no further episodes of chest pain   an echocardiogram was done to evaluate for cardiac function  ejection fraction is now decreased at      and there is global hypokinesis and multiple areas of wall motion abnormalities  she was continued on aspirin  atorvastatin  metoprolol  losartan  and plavix for secondary prevention      congestive heart failure   ms    lasix was held prior to cath  and she was treated with iv fluids for renal protection   she subsequently developed some shortness of breath with exertion   cxr showed an enlarged heart and mild pulmonary congestion   she required supplemental oxygen at  l nasal canula   she was diuresed with iv lasix  and then her po lasix regimen was restarted   she was weaned to room air  and denies shortness of breath at rest  orthopnea  and pnd on the day of discharge   she notes some ongoing shortness of breath with walking for long periods in the halls  but finds this consistent with her baseline   echocardiogram showed reduced cardiac function as described above      hypertension   blood pressure was initially contolled on the patient s outpatient doses of metoprolol  imdur  and losartan  on   the metoprolol was changed to carvedilol   the patient did not tolerate this change and became acutely hypotensive with bp   s   s   she continued to mentate well throughout   she was treated with small iv fluid boluses  and sbp rebounded to the   s   at the same time an emergent hct was drawn and was shown to be     concerning for rp bleed   this value was later found to be in error as the lab was drawn from the line in which saline was infusing   given the emergent concern  however  she was transferred to the ccu   there she received a total of    cc ns and one unit prbc   blood pressure normalized  and antihypertensive meds were restarted at reduced doses   she tolerated these medications without any further episodes of hypotension   she was discharged to   rehab on metoprolol   mg   and losartan   mg daily      cough   the patient had a chronic cough during her hospitalization  which she said repeatedly was her baseline  cxr showed a small left pleural effusion and a questionable retrocardiac opacity  could not rule out pneumonia   however  she was

chest tube air leak  a   mm valve was placed in this location without complication  the balloon was used to occlude the posterior segment  however no decrease in the leak was noted  similarly occlusion of the rml and rll bronchi did not result in decreased leak  there were no complications     m w  persistent right sided bronchopleural fistula and respiratory failure  flexible bronchoscopy

multiple chest tube placed and developing subcutaneous air leakage  requiring trach placement  pneumonia  sepsis  acute renal failure and choledolytiasis   he was weanned off versed and had fentanyl bolus as needed for pain  this seem to have helped with the agitation  but his bp remained labile   he was restarted on some of his anti hypertensive medicaitions and he would then become hypotensive  we also attempted diureses given that he had received a significant amount of fluid during his micu stay  in hopes that this would help with his extubation  his pcos was also very high which he was then allowed to have permisse hypercarbia given his significant hx of copd which was thought to help his respiratory drive  given his sginficant copd hx w  recent hx of trach in   and failure of sbts regardless of multiple attempts  he had a tracheostomy and a peg tube placed by ip  this was after several discussions with the family and while asking the patient when he was more alert if this was his wishes   he became hypotensive during his initial presentation  and with   opacity in his rll concerning for pneumonia  given the severity of his illness and his tenous clinical status he was then started emperically on vancomycin and cefepime  in addition of the azithromycin x   days for copd exacerbation  he had bronch lavage and pan cultures sent which were all negative  however pt persisted with   pneumonia on image and he was initially treated for   day course of antibiotics which was prolonged to    days since his clinical picture was still concerning for infection and he had increase

recommended a percutaneous drain which the family refused given change in goals of care to do not do any invassive procedures and preeceding his cmo code status  he was requiring maximun dose of levophed prior to him being made cmo and his renal function was worsen while his transaminitis were slightly improving  all his cultures remained negative   he was initially hypotensive which was thought to be related to intubation and high peep with potential right sided pneumo and possible sepsis  levophed was weaned off on day      he then became hypertensive with sbp at times up to the    s during awake trials which was thought to be related to agitation and possible pain related to the chest tube and diffused subcatenous air  so he was treated for delerium anxiety with changes in his drips adding standing seroquel  his pain was also treated with fentanyl bolus  however  even though his agitation improved he would still have episodes of hypertension  he was then started on some of his home meds including losartan and carvedilol  in addition to lasix and as needed labetolol  he then would have episodes of hypotension post medications  so we decreased home dose of medications and tried labetolol as needed  we had discussed starting on nitro drip for better bp controlled  however he became hypotensive in the setting of sepsis and all his antihypertensives were stopped  we

the negative head ct and mri mra  her acute mental status change was unlikely related to a stroke   at the outside hospital  there was also a concern for hsv meningitis  though an hsv pcr returned negative   she was transferred to   on ceftriaxone  acyclovir  and vancomycin   she was continued on ceftriaxone and vancomycin and ampicillin was added for listeria   infectious disease was consulted and they recommended discontinuation of vancomycin  they felt the clinical history was most consistent with listeria  though the patient s csf cultures at the outside hospital remained negative   the patient was hypotensive on transfer to the   icu   her hypotension was attributed to sepsis given her elevated lactate and white count   she was transfered on dopamine  mcg kg min and levophed      mcg kg min with a cvp low at     she responded well to fluid boluses and her pressors were weaned off within the first    hours of her admission   a cortisol stimulation test showed adequate adrenal function   she did not require fluid boluses after    hours   the patient was admitted with a creatinine of      her renal failure was attributed to atn in the setting of hypoperfusion and sepsis   her urine sediment was positive for muddy brown casts   her medications were renally dosed   her creatinine improved to     by discharge and her urine output picked up considerably as she mobilized her total body fluid and her kidneys recovered    on transfer  the patient was initially hyperglycemic and required an insulin drip to control her sugars in the setting of the acute infection   during the first       hours  she was transitioned to an insulin sliding scale with nph   the nph dose was titrated down and eventually discontinued and her glipizide was restarted and titrated up as needed    the patient was noted to have a systolic murmur on arrival that was not reported at the outside hospital   this new murmur was concerning for endocarditis versus a high flow murmur from a hyperdynamic state   a transthoracic echo was negative for vegetations  although it did show    mitral regurgitation   on subsequent exams  heart sounds were distant under her coarse breath sounds  so it was difficult to assess the presence or abscence of the murmur   given that all of the blood cultures were negative  endocarditis seemed less likely  as noted above  the patient did not tolerate a tee and it was decided to forgo further testing as the suspcion for endocarditis was quite low   at the outside hospital  she had a drop in hematocrit from    to    and was    on arrival   she had normal hemolysis labs   she was quaiac positive  suggesting a slow gi bleed   her hematocrit drifted down during this admission  which was partially due to dilution with agressive fluid resuscitation and partially due to the gi source   she was transfused for a hematocrit less than      after transfer to the medicine   service  her hematocrit remained stable throughout the remainder of her admission   once she was adequately fluid resuscitated and her sepsis treated and sedation stopped  the patient became hypertensive to the    s   she required numerous doses of iv metoprolol to lower her pressure   she was also loaded with po metoprolol  which was titrated up   she was subsequently restarted on her hydrochlorothiazide and valsartan with good control of her blood pressure   the patient had initial abdominal distension and hypoactive bowel sounds without evidence of an acute abdomen   an abdominal plain film was negative for free air or obstruction   as she had bowel movements  her abdominal distention improved   the patient presented with an anion gap of    and a barcarbonate of     this indicated that she had both an anion gap and a non gap acidoses   factors contributing to her acidosis are lactic acidosis  possible ketoacidosis  and uremia   since her bicarbonate was low  she was given bicarbonate in her fluids   her acidosis improved within    hours of admission    the patient was initially continued on tube feeds  once extubated  the patient passed a speech and swallow evaluation and was given a cardiac diet with thin liquids and regular solids   she episodically complained of pills  getting stuck  though was able to tolerate her food   a barium swallow may be considered as an outpatient   on transfer  insulin drip ns with nahco  at    cc hr

for long term antibiotics   pseudomonas was also cultured from his sputum and was thought to be a colonization    the patient has had a foley catheter in place for at least one to two months because of a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy and urinary retention   a foley catheter was continued during his inpatient hospital stay but he will likely need an outpatient urology evaluation and   or possible transurethral resection of the prostate procedure as indwelling foley catheter may increase his risk for recurrent urinary tract infections and   or future episodes of urosepsis    the

catheterization showing fairly clean coronary arteries   given the clinical circumstance  his elevated troponin was thought to be due to demand ischemia   he was continued on aspirin and beta blocker   consideration was made to starting an ace inhibitor but was not started given his renal failure    his creatinine was elevated up to     on admission thought to be due to his sepsis and decreased

days of flagyl and the cellcept was changed to     mg qid  the stool issue was resolved by day of discharge  the patient was noted to have a slowly drifting hct  and received one unit of blood prior to her discharge  iron studies were also sent  but these may be difficult to interpret as she received blood after the pancreas transplant about    days prior to the testing  immunosuppression was monitored daily with prograf levels  and after her icu stay she was eventually back to   mg    as mentioned  the cellcept was changed to qid  she is off steroids  her blood sugars were very stable in

measuring    mm was identified on imaging    his transaminases trended down quickly  and it was felt that he had spontaneously passed the stone   he was kept npo and given ivf as well as insulin drip   abdominal ct was ordered on   for persistent fevers  he was found to have a necrotic pancreas with no drainable fluid collection   he was maintained on meropenem for possible infected necrotic pancreas and completed a full two week course for that    ards  icu course his course was complicated by sirs and ards   he was intubated for hypoxia  had initial bradycardia and hypotension   he was volume resuscitated and did require pressors which were slowly weaned   his abdomen was distended and very firm  and he had elevated bladder pressures  concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome   surgery was consulted and followed closely  fortunately  his bladder pressures improved  along with his abdominal distention  and he did not require surgery on the abdomen       volume balance mr    was aggressively volume resuscitated at the beginning of his admission due to shock in the setting of pancreatitis   once he stabilized  he was steadily diuresed with lasix drip and then boluses   by the time of discharge  he was approximately     liters positive for the length of stay   he was discharged on lasix    mg iv bid to work towards removing this fluid   this will need to be adjusted as

upon     admission to the neonatal intensive care unit  the     seizures were associated with apnea and she was intubated     and placed on low ventilatory settings  she was extubated     on day of life    to room air  chest x ray was within     normal limits  her baseline respiratory rate was    to        breaths per minute in room air with oxygen saturations     greater than or equal to      a

maintained on intravenous fluids  enteral feeds     were restarted on day of life    but were discontinued     due to concern for possible worsening of her neurological     status  enteral feeds were again started on day of life         and gradually advanced and well tolerated  on day of     life     she presented with coffee ground material by her     nasogastric tube and feedings were once again held      feedings were started again on day of life     and have     been well tolerated since that time  at the time of     discharge she was being fed by gavage  breast milk     fortified to    calories per ounce with   calories of     enfamil powder  her oral intake has been poor  there is     concern that she may need a gastrostomy tube placed at     some juncture   parents are reluctant to have one placed     at this time and would like to provide oral feeds whenever     she is awake   serum electrolytes have been within normal     limits and have been checked numerous times during     admission  most recent serum electrolytes were on       with a serum sodium of      potassium of          chloride of     and total carbon dioxide of         weight on the day of discharge is

and     intravenous ampicillin and gentamycin were started      concern for possible herpes simplex virus was also raised     and   was started on acyclovir  the herpes     simplex virus pcr was negative and the acyclovir was     discontinued  the bacterial cultures were also no growth     and the ampicillin and gentamicin were discontinued  with     the onset of the coffee ground emesis another sepsis     evaluation was done and she was started on vancomycin and     gentamicin  blood culture was no growth at    hours and     the antibiotics were discontinued  she has also been     treated for eye drainage with erythromycin ointment   liver function tests have been sent     numerous times and were within normal limits  peak serum     bilirubin was     total     mg per dl direct

fall in blood hematocrit was attributed to     the multiple laboratory draws required for the     neurological and metabolic work up     presented with seizures from the     time of her admission to the neonatal intensive care     unit  she was started on phenobarbital and a neurology     consult was obtained  a head computer tomography scan was     performed on   with results within normal     limits  magnetic resonant imaging was done on       and repeated on    both examinations were     reported with results within normal limits  the initial     eeg was obtained on   and showed multiple     spike and sharp waves with burst suppression background      the phenobarbital dosing was increased to   mg per     kilogram per day to obtain a maximum level     of      mg per dl   pyridoxine did not reveal any     improvement in eeg pattern  serial eegs have remained     abnormal with most showing some seizure activity with     abnormal background with little state change  an eeg     performed on   showed no seizures but with     abnormal background  most recent eeg was performed on       which showed one   minute seizure     originating from the right hemisphere  the background over     the first two hours of this study looks more continuous     than the previous studies however a burst suppression     pattern was still observed  chromosomes revealed a     karyotype of   xx
