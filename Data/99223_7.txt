admission date          discharge date      service ccu  history of present illnes  mr     i  an    year old woman who wa  in her usual state of health until approximate  six week  prior to admission when she fell and sustain  a nose fracture   she then spent two week  in a rehabilitation facility  went home for one week  and wa  then readmitt  to an outside hospital intensive care unit with a nstemi on     at thi  time  the patient wa  felt to be too debilitat  to undergo cardiac catheterization  and she wa  therefore transferr  to rehabilitation on medical management   after recover   her pcp made arrangement  for her transfer to the   for cardiac catheterization   of note  on    her electrocardiogram demonstrat  t wave inversion  in lead  v  through v   and the patient wa  given enoxaparin  aspirin  and a beta blocker   on the day of admission  the patient underwent cardiac catheterization   thi  study demonstrat  very mild anterior hypokinesi   no mitral regurgitation  and a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximate        her coronary vasculature wa  found to be right dominant   she ha  a normal lmca   there wa  a        elongat  stenosi  in the mid portion of her left anterior descend  artery involv  the take off of a moderate siz  first diagonal branch   there wa         stenosi  of the distal vessel   there i  also     stenosi  of the ostium of d    there wa         stenosi  proximal  in the lcx follow  by a        stenosi   stenose         were also seen in the om   stenose      were seen in the mid portion of the right coronary artery   the left anterior descend  artery wa  successful  stent   and the first diagonal branch wa  rescu  by wire   late in the case  thrombu  wa  not  in the left anterior descend  artery stent   eptifibide wa  then start   and then the stent wa  redilat  with a   mm balloon   short  thereafter  the patient develop  hematemesi  necessitat  discontinuation of the eptifibide   also of note  the patient develop  hypotension several time  dur  the procedure  each time quick  respond  to dopamine   at the end of the case  a right heart catheterization demonstrat  a low rest  right and left heart fill  pressure  and low cardiac index  suggest  hypovolemia   there wa  no equalization of pressure    an echocardiogram demonstrat  a tiny pericardial with no tamponade physiology   there wa  hypokinesi  of the lateral wall with left ventricular ejection fraction of       the patient wa  then transferr  to the ccu in stable condition for further monitor   past medical history    multiple prior fall  with the most recent fall in   while on lorazepam and zolpidem     subdural hematoma in       right sid  cerebrovascular accident complicat  by upper and lower extremity spasticity and hemiparesi

left upper sternal border without rub  or gallop    she had bibasilar crackle  on the left greater than on the right  and no wheeze    her abdomen wa  soft  nontender  and nondistend  and there were normoactive bowel sound    she had left femoral sheath  present without evidence of hematoma   there wa  trace bilateral lower extremity pitt  edema   patient wa  mov  all extremitie  without

medication had been start  in the catheterization laboratory given her hypotension   her postprocedural hypotension wa  most like  secondary to a combination of a vagal reaction and hypovolemia   she wa  transfus  a total of   unit  of pack  r  blood cell  with a good hemodynamic response   she subsequent  remain  hemodynamical  stable throughout the remainder of her admission   in term  of her coronary artery disease  the patient underwent ptca and stent  of the left anterior descend  artery complicat  by transient d  occlusion  restor  with wire  and left anterior descend  artery stent thrombosi   the patient wa  transient  start  on heparin and epidifibitide with resolution of the thrombosi   although she subsequent  develop  gastrointestinal ble    her heparin and eptifibitide were therefore discontinu    she wa  maintain  on aspirin and plavix throughout her hospitalization  although the heparin and eptifibitide were not restart    she wa  subsequent  stabiliz  on a beta
