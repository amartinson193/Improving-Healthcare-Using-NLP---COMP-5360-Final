physiology   the patient presented with acute hypoxia requiring intubation   at the time of presentation patient was suffering from multifocal pneumonia  acute exacerbation of chronic systolic chf likely precipitated by rvr  and large effusion with compressive atelectasis  all of these processes likely contributed to hypoxic respiratory failure at time of presentation   the patient underwent broad spectrum treatment for pneumonia  thoracentesis  and once hemodynamically stable was diuresed allowing extubation on     the patient was extubated without incident and weaned to progressively lower amounts of supplementary oxygen   he is discharged on   liters of o  by nasal canula and o  sats in the high   s   the patient presented in shock with a somewhat mixed picture suggestive of septic but also potentially an element of cardiogenic shock   blood cultures remained negative though he did have multifocal pneumonia   his echocardiogram revealed diminshed ejection fraction of     but likely had further depressed ef on admission due to rvr and decreased ventricular filling time   he initially intermittently required norepeinephrine but this was stopped on   and pressors were not restarted   home lisinopril for blood pressure was held on transfer to  the floor in the setting of elevated creatinine and was stable with systolics from    s    s   the patient was started on vancomycin  cefepime  metronidazole  and azithromycin on presentation for broad empiric coverage of health care associated pneumonia  as he came from a facility    unfortunately bronchoalveolar lavage cultures  sputum  and blood cultures all failed ot reveal an organism   the patient received five days of azithromycin and a total of eight days of vancomycin  cefepime  and metronidazole for empiric coverage of pneumonia   he remained afebrile and initial leukocytosis of    improved   his respiratory support requirements improved and he was extubated   he should have a follow up chest radiograph in   wks to document resolution of his infiltrate   the patient presented with elevated bnp and signs of volume overload   further  when his pleural effusion was tapped it appeared transudative and cultures remained negative consistent with an effusion due to heart failure   he had an echocardiogram that revealed globally diminished contractility but no wall motion abnormalities and troponin negative making acute ischemia unlikely   patient s exacerbation likely due to rvr as well as possible hypokinesis in the context of systemic infection  sepsis   after hemodynamic instability resolved the patient was diuresed with net icu fluid balance of approximately      ml of fluid  on discharge  cxr showed improvement in fluid status and a decrease in his lower extremity edema   prior to admission  pt was on lasix    mg daily  which we stopped on discharge because he appeared to be euvolemic both by exam and on chest xray and will follow up to determine further need for lasix as outpatient   the patient had intermittent spells of rvr in the icu that appeared to negatively affect his hemodynamics  his beta blocker was held due to hypotension so he was amiodarone loaded to try and achieve better rate control with good effect   after hypotension resolved his beta blocker was restarted with good effect   he has   more days of amiodarone loading with     mg   and should f u with a cardiologist to determine continued need for amiodarone   as sepsis resolved the patient become somewhat hypertensive so after being restarted on his home metoprolol he was also started on captopril  which was then switched to lisinopril for easier dosing with good control of blood pressure   lisinopril was stopped on transfer to the floor in the setting of elevated creatinine  with systolic bp    s    s   the   health care proxy is his brother and next of         given the patient is nonverbal and demented at baseline     makes all health care decisions and initially insisted the patient remain full code   this was despite repeatd overtures by the health care team that given the patient s underlying morbidity and poor baseline function his odds of surviving a resusciation or recovering to even his baseline poor functional were poor   this was also discussed with the proxy s daughter and    both nieces of the patient as well  who were understanding of the patient s poor prognosis and very insistent they did not want him to suffer   after discussion of all three of these parties the patient s brother agreed to a code status of dnr dni and agreed he should not be

been pulled in the emergency department    the patient was recently treated for a citrobacter urinary tract infection  however  on this admission she was noted to have enterococcus   it was thought to be associated with the foley catheter   an attempt will be made to remove the foley catheter prior to discharge  however  the patient is indeed suffering from significant urinary retention and this is

and or cholangitis  an lp was preformed revealing no wbc s   blood and urine cx s did not grow out anything  blood cultures from the osh however  grew out klebsiella x   sensitive to levofloxacin  but only intermediately sensitive to cefoxitin  so her ceftriaxone was switched to levofloxacin   a repeat paracentesis was preformed on hd  which revealed       wbcs  down from      at prior to admission   because the wbc decline was not as substantial as anticipated on levofloxcin  flagyl and vancomycin were continued  she was given a course of sepsis dose hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for   days   she did not require pressors  she becamse hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the floor  the patient did not have a repeat paracentesis because her white count continued to decline  flagyl was stopped on    levofloxacin will be continued for a total of    days from the start and she will be placed on cipro     qd for sbp ppx   altered ms     to toxic metabolic encephalopathy secondary to overwhelming sepsis   other etiololgies for altered mental status were investigated  an lp was preformed to rule out meningitis   head ct was preformed and was negative   ammonia levels were checked given her history of cirrhosis  and returned only mildly elevated at      serum and urine tox screens were negative   once extubated  pt was alert and oriented with baseline ms   on admission patient had a primary respiratory alkalosis secondary to persistent tachypnea  likely induced by her septic state   in addition she had a lactic acidosis   her rr had been greater than    for nearly   hours on admission  hence she was intubated to ensure an adequate airway  on hd   after aggressive fluid ressucitation and receiving blood products  she became increasingly hypoxic secondary to pulmonary edema  and required increased peep s to    for adequate oxygenation   she was gently diuresed  and her respiratory status improved   on hd  she was requiring minimal pressure support and peep  and was successfully extubated  she had no ongoing respirtoy issues   developed a cr increase from     to     post diuresis   arf thought to be secondary to intravascular depletion

the   service as well  on her last day of icu stay  her inr rose to       given that she was npo for several days  this was thought to be secondary to malnutrition  and she was given vit k  however  the patient had repeated doses of vitamin k over a few days and her inr failed to respond  this will need to be followed as an outpatient   pt s admission hct was roughly at baseline of      hct

continued to drop during hospital course  with no evidence of obvious bleed or hemolysis   the likely cause is splenic sequestration   pt was transfused to keep plts     prior to invasive procedure  otherwise    k unless suspicion for active bleed   her platlets were    on day of discharge and this will need to be followed closely as an outpatient   most likely due to mild tissue hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis  although liver enzymes may be elevated due to cholangitis as noted above   liver enzymes gradually declined throughout stay with adequate hydration   pts sulfasalizine was continued   stress dose steroids were started in setting of sepsis in place of budesonide for total of   days  the patient was tapered to   mg of prednisone and will continue on this  budesemide was

the right  left and main portal veins were once again thrombosed with thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein as well   therefore the patient was brought to the operating room for evacuation of the intra abdominal blood and hematoma with attempt at open portal vein thrombectomy on    a large amount of old blood and clots were then removed  since the porta was quite deep and foreshortened  the gallbladder was removed for better exposure  a dissection to identify the portal vein was attempted  however due to extensive collaterals and few viable planes  the attempt at portal vein thrombectomy was abandoned due to the risk of proceeding  hemostasis was obtained  and surgicel was used superiorly and inferiorly  the patient returned to the icu postoperatively  off his heparin drip and

on discharge were appropriately titrated  and follow up labs were arranged  which the patient will fax to dr   office for further titration and management of his anticoagulation regimen going forward  his pain medications were transitioned from iv to oral when the patient was tolerating a regular diet  on discharge he was in minimal pain  and was ambulating independently  tolerating a regular diet    while inpatient  the patient was followed by the gastroenterology service given his history of crohn s disease  and also was seen by the hematology service to asses the cause of his portal vein thrombosis  his home clomiphene and forteo were held given their association with clotting  and a hypercoagulability workup was sent  which was entirely negative at the time of discharge  see labs

admission for acute alcoholic hepatitis with a peak bilirubin of       re presented to an outside hospital with complaints of shortness of breath and delta ms  transferred here for continued care    the patient presents with delta ms likely due to hepatic encephalopathy   thus he was continued on lactulose   his lasix  spironolactone and propranolol were held due to hypotension and hyperkalemia  the patient s liver function worsened over the course of this admission and likely was the underlying cause of his demise    the patient presents with history of heavy alcohol use   however  he had been abstinent for days while hospitalized at the va   he has no history of dts per his children   he was continued on thiamine and folate and showed no evidence of withdrawal    the patient intubated at an outside hospital for unclear reasons  i suspect secondary to delta ms     protection   however  the patient tachypneic and thus may have been compensating for a metabolic acidosis due to possible excessive lactate   initial abg consistent with a persistent respiratory acidosis  thus his ventilator settings were manipulated overnight to improve ventilation and his ph subsequently responded   he was maintained on scheduled nebulizers and initially started on     mg solu medrol t i d  this was gradually tapered over the course of this admission  his admission was complicated by episode during which he bit his tube and required reintubation  during which he had vomiting and likely aspiration   he also self extubated himself during the course of admission  again requiring reintubation   he was noted to have ongoing paradoxical breathing  likely due to his abdominal hypertension   large volume paracentesis did not improve his respiratory mechanics   in addition  lasix diuresis caused elevation of the creatinine and thus was not tolerated   thought was with renal recovery his bicarbonate would increase again permitting extubation   however  no interventions during the course of admission permitted extubation from the ventilator    the patient presented with a creatinine of     up from his discharge creatinine from the   hospital of       initial concern for prerenal failure due to hypovolemia in the setting of hypotension  however  as his urine output improved with fluid resuscitation and pressor support  however  his creatinine again later in the course of his hospital stay began to rise   his bladder pressure at that time was noted to be     a large volume paracentesis failed to result in a improvement in his creatinine and thus he was started on midodrine and octreotide for likely hepatorenal syndrome   his urine output subsequently improved with hope for renal recovery   as volume became an issue  lasix diuresis was attempted  however  his creatinine bumped in response to this and no further lasix was attempted   he ultimately required hemodialysis for an increasing metabolic acidosis   his worsening renal failure was attributed to likely a dense atn in the setting of his hypotension requiring pressor support    the patient initially started on ceftriaxone and flagyl for concern for sbp versus aspiration pneumonia   his initial paracentesis was not consistent with sbp and his chest x ray remained negative for infiltrate   nevertheless  he was continued on levofloxacin for a presumed pneumonia  blood cultures remained negative until later in his hospital admission following successful wean off of his initial pressors including dopamine and vasopressin  at which time  his blood cultures became positive for vancomycin resistant enterococcus   of note  an initial   stim test was done to rule out adrenal insufficiency and stimulated appropriately to        also  likely underlying his hypertension is systemic vasodilation secondary to hepatic disease  nevertheless  as stated above  following wean off of dopamine and vasopressin  the patient again became hypotensive  blood  urine and sputum cultures were sent   he was restarted on levophed as blood and urine subsequently grew out vancomycin resistant enterococcus   he was thus continued on linezolid and ceptaz for a possible sbp and flagyl for a possible clostridium difficile in the setting of ongoing diarrhea   despite line changes and continued antibiotic support  the patient subsequently became fungemic   he was started on caspofungin   ct of the abdomen was negative for perforation and ercp was negative for cholangitis   his fungemia was likely secondary to severe immunocompromise due to his ongoing vre sepsis   on the day of his death  the patient s map decreased into the   s   i was discussed with the patient s girlfriend regarding the futility of further fluid boluses or manipulation of his pressors   thus all pressors were discontinued     minutes later  the patient agreed to follow up with extubation   the patient passed approximately    minutes following extubation    the patient s altered mental status was likely due to hepatic encephalopathy   he was continued on lactulose with minimal improvement   paracentesis was done to rule out sbp and remained negative    the patient continued on a regular sliding scale insulin for blood sugar control    during the course of the patient s admission  his bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase increased concerning for obstructive like picture   ultrasound negative for portal vein thrombosis or common bile duct dilation   likely these laboratory abnormalities are secondary to severe sepsis    this issue developed following a right femoral line   the patient received ddavp  cryo and ffp to alleviate bleeding   on subsequent cts  this bleed was noted to be stable    the patient started on tube feeds on     he received kayexalate for hyperkalemia
