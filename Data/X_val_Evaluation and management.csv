was thought to be multifactorial   resulting from critical as  chf  and complicated by a pneumonia  she did not have the reserve to compensate for that type of pulmonary insult    she had her hypotension  presumably due to urosepsis  treated primarily with neo due to the rate effect of levophed  but this was turned off according to the wishes of the patients family    several family meetings were held with the meeting on   ending in the family making the decision to make the patient     at that point all antibiotics and pressor medications were discontinued  a morphine drip was

old woman who has had previous admissions for gi bleeding without a source being identified  she had known diverticulosis  on   she continued to drop her hematocrit gradually and a bleeding scan was ordered  the scan was positive in the distribution of the ileocolic vessels  it could not be clearly seen whether there was distal ileal disease or right colon disease  the patient underwent a follow up arteriogram which was negative  however  over the course the day she required transfusion of multiple units for continued slow bleeding  she agreed to surgical excision of the affected area as indicated by the bleeding scan    the patient was taken to the operating room  and after satisfactory induction of general endotracheal anesthesia  she was prepped and draped in the usual fashion  she had a previous hysterectomy incision that was well healed  this was a vertical incision  a midline laparotomy scar was carried out through skin and subcutaneous tissue and fascia  the belly was opened in the supraumbilical position to be in virgin territory  the abdomen was opened and there few adhesions  the right colon was mobile and easily brought up out of the gutter  there was not a large amount of blood in the colon  but the patient had had a bowel prep as a colonoscopy had been anticipated  in the distribution of the ileocolic artery  there were very large mesenteric lymph nodes traveling along the path of the ileocolic artery  these were confined to this area and not found diffusely throughout the bowel  there were no palpable lesions in the right colon  there were findings of some thickening of the small bowel wall again in the distribution of the ileocolic artery  these were small limited areas  a mesenteric lymph node was harvested for intraoperative frozen section and this was unrevealing of carcinoma  the small bowel was divided proximal to the most palpably abnormal section and the abnormal lymph nodes and divided with     stapler  likewise the right colon was divided just proximal to the middle colic vessels  the right colon was mobilized up out of the right gutter in the usual manner  the duodenum was seen and preserved  using a ligasure  the mesentery was sequentially divided  despite   applications of the ligasure  there was not a good seal in the vessels and larger vessels were clamped and ligated  hemostasis was assured  the specimen was sent to pathology  the side to side functional end to end anastomosis was created with staplers in the usual fashion  crotch stitches were placed  the ta staple line was inspected and oversewn as appropriate  hemostasis was assured  sponge count was correct and the abdomen was closed with running suture  a pain pump was placed on the fascia and the skin was closed  the wounds were cleaned and dressed and the patient was taken from the operating room to the recovery room in stable condition  estimated blood loss was    ml  and sponge  needle and instrument counts were reported to be correct x    ms    was admitted to the tsicu for serial hematocrits and hemodynamic monitoring   her hematocrit started at    and quickly fell to      of note  her wbc count at admission was      however the patient reports a history of leukocytosis undefined myeloproliferative disorder for which she is followed by dr    at   with a chronically elevated wbc count   given her cardiac history and active bleeding she was transfused to maintain a hematocrit above      she was kept npo   a tagged red blood scan was done on   which showed a slow bleed in the rlq at    minutes   as this was felt to be fairly nonspecific and she continued to have blood bowel movements with drops in her hematocrit  an angiogram was done on     the angiogram however did not show an active bleed   at this point she had recieved    units of blood  overnight on   she again had a bloody bowel movement and dropped her hematocrit   in consultation with the gastroenterologists  we planned for a colonoscopy on   in hopes of identifying the location of the bleed   she was prepped with golytely   in the am of   her hematocrit had dropped to    and at this point she had required a total of    units of blood  the decision was made to proceed directly to the operating room   she underwent an ileocectomy as there was a question of an inflammatory mass in the rlq and the positive tagged scan in the rlq   she tolerated the

there was concern of a pneumonia vs  pulmonary edema  she was initially treated for possible hospital acquired pneumonia and an aspiration pneumonia  initial treatment was with vancomycin and zosyn  this was transitioned to cefepime  vancomycin  cipro  and flagyl  her sputum grew out pseudomonas and mrsa  though it was unclear whether this data reflected chronic colonization versus pathogenic infection  treatment for pna was continued based on ct evidence of rll consolidation  she completed   days of vancomycin but then had a borderline fever  so it was restarted   he will continue a    day course of vancomycin and cefepime to co treat pseuodmonas pneumonia and e coli urosepsis  to be completed on    with antibiotics and nebulizer treatments  her oxygen was weaned to baseline        via trach mask   trach exchange and pmv can be done in the outpatient setting        urinary tract infection urosepsis   she was found to have pan sensitive e coli in her urine as well as in her blood

commands and answering questions  and at times indifferent to them   this pattern was felt to be due to hypoactive delirium in the setting of acute infection which improved by the time of discharge to

of acute onset  this was also in the setting of sudden onset chills alternating with sweats and diarrhea  cta chest showed moderate pericardial effusion but no dissection  etiology was thought to be viral given concurrent chills and diarrhea  a rapid respiratory viral screen was attempted but the specimen was inadequate  tb was considered unlikely because her ct was normal and she lacked other symptoms  no other sx of rheumatic disease so this was also thought to be unlikely  tsh was checked and was slightly low  malignancy workup was up to date as an outpatient per the patient   hr was in

discontinued in the afternoon of pod    six hours after the epidural was discontinued  as he was unable to void  the foley was replaced  and he was started on flomax  post splenectomy immunizations consisting of the pneumovax  meningicoccal  and haemophilus b vaccines were given on pod    at this point  the patient was being prepared for discharge in the next     days    on pod    the patient went into atrial fibrillation  which could not be converted on the floor with metoprolol and lasix  the patient was emergently transferred to the ticu for further evalaution and care  he was intubated

epiglottis  false vocal cords and some supraglottic narrowing  also noted to have exudative process surrounding the right false vocal cord  given her fever and bandemia on admission this is most likely to be infectious and concerning for bacterial infection  patient was therefore started on iv unasyn and also given high dose iv steroids due to concern for airway narrowing  patient at no point

pacing for complete heart block  within    hours  he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated on postoperative day one  on postoperative day two  he complained of mild abdominal pain associated with abdominal distention  an nasogastric tube was placed  general surgery was consulted and multiple imaging studies were obtained  ct scan was unremarkable except for pulmonary edema while abdominal ultrasound revealed only mild gallbladder distention with small amount of sludge  he concomitantly experienced worsening oxygenation and required reintubation on pod   at that time  he was noted to

increased difficulty breathing when you laid down flat   you were given extra diuretics to remove fluid  and we removed nearly    liters worth   dr    felt that you would benefit from further diuresis with continuous medications through the iv called furosemide and milrinone   you then had a catheterization procedure to measure the pressures in your heart  unfortunately  this revealed that the changes in your pacemaker and milrinone were not enough to make your heart squeeze well  therefore  we felt it was best you were evaluated by   for consideration of a left ventricular assist device

known mitral valve prolapse for approximately the last four years  he was always told he had a heart murmur since childhood but was not diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse until   when he was worked up for dizziness  more recently he developed a febrile illness following in   which consisted of a few weeks of fever  sweats and cough  he had significantly exerted himself for several hours shoveling snow and came ill a day or two later  he was ultimately diagnosed with pneumonia and placed on antibiotics  around the same time  he had obtained a new primary care physician and given his history of mitral valve prolapse  an echocardiogram had been electively scheduled for further follow up  this revealed a newly flail posterior mitral leaflet with severe regurgitation  a dilated left ventricle and pulmonary hypertension  as this was found in conjunction with his febrile illness and he had his teeth cleaned several weeks prior  there was a concern for endocarditis however work up was negative  currently he admits to fatigue and overall not feeling well the last few months  he does not have any chest discomfort  palpitations  orthopnea or exertional dyspnea  due to

mildly thickened with more severe thickening of the posterior leaflet with flail of the p  and p  scallops  an eccentric  anteriorly directed jet of severe      mitral regurgitation is seen  due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet  its severity may be significantly underestimated  coanda effect   there is no pericardial effusion  postbypass  the patient is in sinus rhythm and on an

well after the heart attack  therefore  you have been changed from dabigitran to warfarin until your heart wall motion improves  it is very important that you take all of your medicines and optimize your blood sugar control    we made the following changes to your medicines     stop taking wellchol  dabigitran  metoprolol  odansetron  hydrochlorothiazide  and flecainide    start taking aspirin     mg daily and plavix    mg daily to prevent the stents from clotting off     start taking atorvastatin to lower your cholesterol    start taking warfarin instead of dabigitran to prevent blood clots and a stroke    start taking nitroglycerin if you have chest pain at home  take one tablet under your tongue and wait   minutes  you can take another tablet if you still have chest pain but please call     if the chest pain persists     start co enzyme q   to prevent muscle aches from the atorvastatin    start enoxaparin sc to take twice daily until the inr is          start mag oxide twice

catheterized  prior to the procedure  we put her out supine on the bed and discussed our findings with her that the left side  that is the operative side  was short by approximately     cm  she apparently was unaware of this  she also has a positive galeazzi on the left  with these considerations in mind  we had greater opportunity to lengthen her to equalize her leg lengths  it also be noted that she had a markedly high neck shaft angle  therefore  we chose the     series     p m  position for maximal stability posteriorly  on the femoral side  standard reaming and broaching with an osteotome was performed  we put a cerclage wire in prophylactically at the level of the lesser trochanter  we never did see any crack  final seating of the broach performed  a     fit her very well with certainly no opportunity to go higher than that given her anatomy  we then press fit in the above mentioned stem  we found that a    more equalized her leg lengths and provided excellent

failure  the patient s presenting respiratory failure was likely multifactorial with an element of chf  copd  and opioid overdose  she was intubated in the unit but came to the floor extubated and doing well from respiratory standpoint with o  sats in the mid   s on room air    the patient was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin on    the plan was to complete a    day course which was to finish on    however  the patient signed out ama on   without receiving any prescriptions for her medications  she stated to the nurse that she wanted to leave by       am on    as the patient s vna services were not set up at that time  it was not possible to discharge her  apparently  the patient came to the desk  dressed and ready to leave  at about       and then  without speaking with myself or another physician on our team  ran to the elevators  she did sign an ama form  the patient did leave with a picc line which was placed on   without problem  upon learning of the patient s leaving  dr    will try to contact her in regard to removal of the picc line    that patient s sputum on   showed gram negative rods  otherwise sputums were negative    while admitted  she did receive albuterol atrovent nebs and fluticasone inhaler    she did not appear to be volume overloaded once she reached the floor    tox screen positive for cocaine and opiods on admission  the patient was counselled to stop using these drugs as they clearly are having adverse consequences on her health       coagulase negative bacteremia  while hospitalized  the patient did receive vancomycin and levofloxacin as above which was to finish on    it was decided that the patient did not require a tee to evaluate for vegetations based on her sensitive cultures and lack of new murmur    gram stain

mild edema on cxr  this was likely not the only cause of rest failure       abdominal pain  it is likely that the patient s abdominal pain on admission was related to arf  her ct of the abdomen was negative  there was no evidence that this represented an atypical mi as her troponin was only      in setting of arf and she reports pain different than previous cardiac pain  her ekg was unchanged from baseline       leukocytosis   blood cultures grew coag negative staph on    and    cxr was without a focal infiltrate  the patient did receive a azithromycin prior to admission  she was on

due to   chf exacerbation    the patient was continued on her aspirin and plavix    her lipitor was restarted once her cks began to normalize and we were less concerned about rhabdomyolysis    the patient was also continued on metoprolol and lisinopril  which was restarted once her creatinine normalized        dm   the patient was on glyburide as an outpatient  in the setting of renal failure  the glyburide was held and her fingersticks were closely monitored  she was covered with sliding scale insulin       smoking   the patient received a nictonine patch   mcg x   week while hospitalized with hopes to decrease the dose each week if the patient uses this as an outpatient       fen  the patient tolerated a cardiac heart healthy diet  her electrolytes were repleted as necessary       ppx
