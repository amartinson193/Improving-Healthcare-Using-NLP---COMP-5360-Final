there was no further action to be taken at this time  only physical therapy and supportive care    the patient s was transfused   units over the course of his hospitalization for a drop in his

   sex   m   med   during these three weeks mr    remained in the medical intensive care unit and his hospital course was complicated by a few issue    mr    continued to have fevers  which    initially were of unknown origin   at the same time he was    discovered to have a retroperitoneal bleed  which was    thought to be possibly responsible for the fevers   chest    x ray was unremarkable   blood cultures revealed   out of      bottles on one day only with enterococcus                which was vancomycin resistant   as a result he was    started on linezolid with resolution of the fevers   given    the quick resolution of the fevers it was thought that    this was most likely a line infection or incidental    contamination  which happened to occur at the same time    that the patient was experiencing fevers caused by a    different etiology   given his previous history of vre    bacteremia and the possibility that he has complex    atheromas on his aortic arch  which could have vegetations    on them it was decided to treat him for two weeks with    linezolid starting from     urinalysis revealed    yeast infection with more then         colonies   this    issue was discussed with the infectious disease team who    felt that treatment at this time while the patient was on    antibiotics and at the same time also had a foley in place    would have been useless   it was therefore decided not to    treat him until the foley could be discontinued and all    antibiotics would be stopped  the fungal urinary tract    infection was not thought to be responsible for the    fevers    mr    developed a    retroperitoneal bleed while on coumadin with elevated inr    up to       his hematocrit dropped to approximately    and    he required several blood transfusions in order to keep it    above     which was the target that the team had    established given his prior history of coronary artery    disease   a ct of the abdomen and groin was obtained     which revealed retroperitoneal bleed extended also in the    anterior aspect of the right thigh and layered   therefore    representing two kinds of blood one side and the other one    still liquid suggesting a chronic rather then acute bleed     the vascular surgery team was consulted and they    recommended to intervene on this hematoma   the inr was    reversed with fresh frozen platelets and coumadin and the    hematoma has been resolving slowly since    the patient required anticoagulation for    history of hit  which happened during this    hospitalization  but prior to   as stated above the    patient became supratherapeutic and developed a    retroperitoneal bleed   however  once the retroperitoneal    bleed stabilized and his inr level came down to     low    dose coumadin was restarted and eventually increased again    to     mg po q d   after only one day of coumadin     mg    po q d  an inr of       the target inr is     to        mr    mental status waxed    and waned during this three weeks   at his best he was    able to follow commands  which included sticking out his    tongue  opening and closing his eyes  nodding and    shrugging the right shoulder   however  as increased    sedation was required to address his tachypnea  which    appeared to be secondary to discomfort  mr       became more drowsy and unable to follow commands   a head    ct was obtained  which revealed no acute pathology    including no intracranial bleed or embolic stroke   the    neurology team was reconsulted and they recommended five    sessions of plasmapheresis   mr    at this time    has received three sessions of plasmapheresis  which occur    three times a week   so far there has been no noticeable    improvement in his mental status    mr    is currently trached    throughout these past three weeks   he usually tolerated    pressure support of    to    with a peep of    however     occasionally without any clear trigger he has had episodes    of tachypnea up to the   s and tachycardia   at this time    his tidal volumes drop  but his oxygenation remained    stable around    to     percent on an fio  of    percent     occasionally this improved with switching him to ac     however  once switched on ac sometimes he would continue    to over breath the vent maintaining a respiratory rate of    around    to      several chest x rays were obtained    during these episodes and consistently revealed clear    lungs   he never dropped his oxygenation and his chest x     rays were clear and his examinations revealed good breath    sounds throughout   it was thought to be most likely    neurological possibly secondary to pain or anxiety and it    was addressed by providing him with constant sedation     the constant sedation decreased his events of

examination  and his admission cxr   he was admitted to the ccu for continued care   his enzymes were cycled to rule out ischemia as a cause of his chf exacerbation   there was no evidence of ischemia on ekg   he was treated with antibiotics for presumed infection  he was initially started on levofloxacin   he was also diuresed with lasix   the day after admission vancomycin and flagyl were added for additional antibiotic coverage   on the evening after admission he developed increased respiratory distress   agressive diuresis  morphine  nitro  and bipap were tried with no sucess   he was intubated for respiratory distress  a swan was placed and a head ct was obtained   his swan numbers indicated that he was fluid overloaded so he was diuresed    he continued to spike temperatures despite being on levo  vanco  and flagyl   he was diuresed agressively with lasix and developed a metabolic alkalosis secondary to contraction   he was treated with bumex for a few days   then his alkalosis was treated with a tight kcl sliding scale   he continued to spike fevers and sputum cultures revealed mrsa   his lines were changed   since he continued to spike and have positive cultures despite vanco he was changed to linezolid and the levofloxacin and flagyl were dcd   his wbc count continued to trend down from admission   his respiratory status improved  his wbc count improved  and his cxr improved   based upon good response to a pressure trial he was extubated on hospital day      he did well post extubation   he had some diarrhea the evening following extubation which was found to be c diff positive   he was restarted on flagyl    based upon his improved respiratory status and lack of fevers it was felt he was stable to be discharged from the ccu and sent to the floor   we continued to diurese him but with much less close monitoring than had been occuring in the unit   on hospital day     he was found to be very crackly on exam with marked respiratory distress   his antibiotics were broadened to zosyn  flagyl  linezolid   he was transferred up to the ccu with concern that he had become fluid overloaded again   his lt ij was removed and a rt ij placed with swan   the swan indicated that he was fluid overloaded and he was aggressively diuresed with lasix   he was noted to have a swollen wrist and ankle on arrival to the ccu   an attempt was made to remove fluid from his ankle which was unsucessful   that evening he became increasingly hypoxic with sob  he also became hypotensive   he was tried on bipap and given neo then dopamine for bp support  he did not tolerate bipap and was intubated  he continued to require neo for bp support  which was weaned off slowly   he was diuresed with lasix based upon cxr which indicated that he was fluid overloaded   a repeat echo was performed which indicated an improvement in his ef to         on hospital day    a bronchoscopy was performed and sample sent for culture   he was was eventually exubated in the ccu after aggresive diuresis   bal results came back positive for stenotrophomonas  xanthomonas  maltophilia which was sensitive for bactrim   however at that point patient looked much improved with no recent spike in temperature  respiratory decompensation  or increase in wbc   it was agreed upon to hold off on treating with bactrim and if patient decomensated in future we would treat   however patient never showed any evidence of furter active infection   linezolid and zosyn course were completed while patient was in hospital   patient was transferred back to the floor out of the unit   patient still had crackles on lung exam but based on exam and swan numbers  before swan taken out  patient was dry   a ct chest was ordered which showed resolving ards and fibrosis   patient should

s p treatment of multilobar pna sepsis       pneumonia   the patient was transferred from the micu to the floor with multilobar pna and sepsis  likely secondary to immunosuppression s p orthotopic liver transplant  on transfer the patient was continued on meropenem and azithromycin and was followed by id  the patient demonstrated significant improvement in his pneumonia clinically and radiographically without further need for oxygen requirement  the patient was maintained on meropenem and azithromycin with bactrim ppx for the majority of his admission with plan for total course of therapy of    days  this was switched to levofloxacin prior to d c per i d s recommendation with planned course of therapy for   additional days on d c to complete a    day course of abx  as detailed in h p  all sputum and blood cultures were unrevealing including extensive workup for atypical pathogens including crypto  cmv ebv legionella afb  and chlamydia pneumoniae       s p liver transplant   the patient was admitted s p orthotopic liver transplant for indications of hcc and hepatocellular carcinoma  the patient s immunosuppression regimen was modified this admission secondary to leukopenia  on admission the patient was maintained with rapamycin and cellcept with discontinuance of cellcept and change in rapamycin dosing from  mg po qd to  mg po qd as dictated by serum drug levels  the patient continued to have chronic abdominal pain  see below  which was not thought to represent acute rejection  the patient demonstrated a mild transaminitis throughout his hospital course but with levels that were relatively stable and without evidence for severe hepatic dysfunction  the patient will continue to have his immunosuppressive regimen and transplant function monitored very carefully as an outpatient       abdominal pain   the patient was admitted with known chronic abdominal pain  previous workup for which has been unrevealing  pain control was difficult and the patient s pain regimen underwent a number of revisions during his hospitalization  on admission the patient was on a regimen including oxycontin   mg po bid  neurontin    mg po bid and percocet prn  the patient was initially maintained with prn oxycodone with addition of a fentanyl patch for long acting control  this was subsequently changed per the patient s request back to oxycontin with oxycodone rescue  however  this resulted in recrudescence of the patient s pain for which his pain regimen was changed back to a fentanyl patch with standing oxycodone q  hours  with refusal allowed  as well as an increase in neurontin from    mg po bid to tid  the patient was not overly sedated with this regimen and was discharged with a final regimen of fentanyl patch   mcg  oxycodone  mg po q   hr prn and neurontin    mg po tid as well as plans towards ongoing pain management consultation as an outpatient       leukopenia   the patient developed a leukopenia with nadir anc as low as      thought likely to be secondary to a drug effect  the patient underwent first alterations in his antibiotic regimen from zosyn and vanc to   and azithro as detailed above  as this change did not result in improvement in the patient s leukopenia  it was thought most likely that his immunosuppressive regimen was likely responsible  given this  cellcept was discontinued and rapamycin was continued  dosed by levels  the patient was started on neupogen with subsequent jump in wbc in one day from     to       neupogen was discontinued and the patient s white count was monitored  the patient was discharged with rapamycin alone with plans to continue to monitor wbc as well as lfts to guide the most appropriate level of immunosuppression as an outpatient       hypothyroidism  the patient was continued on his outpatient dose of synthroid    mcg qd      hypertension   the patient s outpatient regimen of lopressor   mg po bid and norvasc  mg po qd was initially held given the patient s hypotension on admission  during his micu course  lopressor was reintroduced with introduction of lisinopril  mg po qd instead of norvasc  likely secondary to history of dm  although most recent hga c      and patient is off dm meds  the patient s bp was well controlled during hospital course with stable renal function after resolution of initial failure in

remained sedated and intubated  his hospital course by systems is as follows   there was no intracranial hemorrhage noted on initial and on repeat head ct imaging  he initially required sedation while in the icu while ventilated  eventually his sedation was weaned off  his current mental status at time of this dictation is awake  alert  very interactive  he is ambulating with a rolling walker and walking all around the trauma floor without any complaints   his hearing is somewhat decreased though he seems to be able to hear everyone speaking in normal tones   on exam his right ear outer canal had some old blood visible and cerumenex was started to soften it up   once weaned and extubated he remained in the icu for close monitoring  his saturations remained stable throughout his icu stay

is usually asymptomatic and doesn t necessarily require stopping the offending medication  and that regardless of the cause of his eosinophilia  its diagnosis is unlikely to affect his short term prognosis and can be further worked up if it doesn t resolve once his antibiotic course is finished   has a history of chronic pain related to his spine  was evaluated by the pain service while in the

 medical condition     year old man with h o mrsa sternal osteomyelitis s p prior cabg s p debridement plates placed in early    now with increased tenderness  erythema in inferior  rd of sternum  elevated inflamm markers final report since    sternal wires have been removed and transverse costosternal stabilization plates have been applied  at all levels  there is failure of fusion of the sternotomy and the extent of separation between the sternal fragments is either stable or in the lower sternum increased  at several levels the widening is due to both diastasis and bone resorption  for example at    cm inferior to the sternal notch        the transverse diameter of the right fragment is      mm now  previously      mm  and the left is      mm  previously      mm while the width of separation is now      mm  previously     mm  similar findings are present continuously from that level to the xiphoid  apparent thickening of the caliber of the pectoralis major muscle that may be due to difference in arm position  but there is subcutaneous emphysema of the midline  anterior chest wall at several levels  in the midline presternal soft tissues      cm inferior to the sternal notch is a collection of small gas bubbles in the thickened muscle  although the previous midline collection that ran anterior to the manubrium and upper sternal body has been drained  starting    cm inferior to the sternal notch        and running for at least   cm inferiorly  and adjacent to the levels of maximum sternal resorption  is a new midline fluid collection with irregular margins  and maximum transverse diameters of    x    mm        the small volume of retrosternal fluid at these levels is inseparable from a small pericardial effusion at the junction of the lower sternal body with the xiphoid           although these intrathoracic fluid collections are unchanged since    since they are contiguous with the new  presumably purulent presternal collection  the transthoracic extension of infection cannot be excluded  respiratory motion obscures some of the fine detail in the lung  but there is no pulmonary edema  consolidation  substantial atelectasis and or any nodule   tiny bilateral pleural effusions and small pericardial effusion are unchanged  enlargement of the upper paratracheal lymph nodes has decreased  but the right lower paratracheal complex is    mm across in aggregate  previously    mm and left lower paratracheal and prevascular nodes have grown from   mm to   and   mm wide respectively  moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette  particularly due to a dilated left ventricle  has increased  this study is not designed for assessment of the upper abdomen  but there is no indication of extension of infection to that region  a gastrostomy tube has a normal appearance  impression     development of new lower midline presternal collection  after drainage of the upper portion  and sternal separation  presumably infectious  multifocal bone resorption of the sternal fragments has progressed  concerning for multilevel osteomyelitis  edema of the lower anterior chest wall does not necessarily represent tissue infection  the only reason to presume that a small retrosternal collection and small pericardial effusion  at the levels of the new lower presternal abscess  are not infected  is that neither has enlarged or developed gas

of       the patient was then referred to dr      for coronary artery bypass graft   on    the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times two with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery   the surgery was performed by dr      with     and     as nurse practitioner   the surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with cardiopulmonary bypass time about    minutes and a crossclamp time of    minutes   the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit  in normal sinus rhythm on neo synephrine and propofol drips with atrial and ventricular pacing wires  one mediastinal and one left pleural chest tube   after arrival in the surgical intensive care unit the patient was noted to have ventricular tachycardia which deteriorated into ventricular fibrillation with hypotension  he was defibrillated times one with     joules and he returned to   sinus rhythm   he then had subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram and electrocardiogram which were done with no significant changes   on postoperative day    he was still on propofol drip which was weaned and when the patient awoke he was very lethargic and restless  following commands   he became hypotensive and his neo drip was titrated   he also had his external pacer rate increased and again he became hypotensive   he had been transfused   unit of packed red blood cells in the morning for a hematocrit of       and was given an additional unit of packed red blood cells   he was started on epinephrine drip but then became tachycardiac  so he was subsequently started on milrinone drip and epinephrine was weaned off   his chest x ray the morning of postoperative day    showed left lower lung collapse and therefore he received therapeutic bronchoscopy where a large greenish mucous plug was removed  he was suctioned for a scant amount of thick secretions  also the patient was started on precedex secondary to agitation and this was titrated to good effect   he was also on amiodarone drip secondary to his dysrhythmia and subsequently had no further ectopy   by postoperative day    he received an additional bronchoscopy for secretions and therapeutic need in an attempt to extubate   he precedex was weaned and he was extubated on postoperative day      at that point his milrinone was able to be weaned with a good cardiac output of greater than     on the over night period of postoperative day     he did have some rapid atrial fibrillation to    s   he received additional amiodarone and was started on beta blocker   after multiple doses of intravenous lopressor and increasing his p o  lopressor up to    mg he converted to normal sinus rhythm   by postoperative day    he still had some mild confusion but he was ready for transfer to the floor   he continued in normal sinus rhythm with some premature atrial contractions and was continued on levaquin for his sputum   when the patient was transferred to the floor  later that afternoon he became agitated and wanted to leave   he dressed himself and headed for the door but then was able to receive haldol   mg intramuscularly  calmed down and returned to his bed   following that incident his confusion improved daily until the time of discharge where he is alert and oriented times three   on postoperative day    it was noted that his blood sugars have been elevated and he has been receiving sliding scale insulin frequently each day  a   consult was obtained and he was eventually started on glyburide   mg p o  q  day   the sliding scale insulin did keep him in good control but this was not a good option for him upon discharge to home    medquist              t            job

pathologically enlarged axillary  mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes  there are a couple of tiny lymph nodes noted anterior to the carina  which do not meet ct criteria for pathologic enlargement  lung fields are slightly blurred due to respiratory motion  no nodule or consolidation is identified  the central airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally   there are multiple areas of abnormal enhancement throughout the liver  these areas of abnormal enhancement are not fully characterized on this single phase exam  they may represent multiple small vascular malformations or hemangiomas  but further imaging is recommended for further characterization  within the medial left lobe  there is a small rounded hypodensity that is too small to characterize  more superiorly and laterally within the left lobe  there is a rounded hypodensity  which may represent a cyst  also within the left lobe  on image     there is an oval area of hypoenhancement  which is also not fully characterized  the gallbladder  spleen and adrenal glands are normal  there is evidence of pancreatic divisum  with prominence of branch ducts within the pancreatic head  an ipmt cannot be excluded  and further evaluation of this finding is also recommended  the kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally  however  there are multiple somewhat linear areas within the cortex of the kidneys bilaterally  which do not enhance and likely represent scars   there are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions      no evidence of aortic dissection     no lung nodules or masses identified     multiple perfusion abnormalities within the liver  and a hypodense lesion within the left lateral lobe also not completely characterized  while the perfusion abnormalities could represent multiple small vascular malformations or hemangiomas  additional characterization with mr of the abdomen is recommended     evidence of pancreatic divisum  with dilation of branch pancreatic ducts within the pancreatic head  mri is also recommended to evaluate for ipmt     bilateral cortical scars of the kidneys   findings  diffusion weighted imaging demonstrates no evidence of acute infarction  however  t  weighted imaging demonstrates diffuse white matter hyperintensities involving both cerebral hemispheres  no areas of increased susceptibility are seen to suggest chronic

woman with a history of htn who presented with a   week history of left sided deep thoracic back pain  and   days of gait difficulties  trouble going up stairs   the back pain was related to movement  but has been getting worse apart from movement  in the ed at      she had a normal exam except for except a question of dysmetria on the right and a wide based  stumbling gait  head ct was negative  mri head did not show acute pathology or mass  but showed some diffuse white matter changes  she was admitted given her inability to safely walk  as well as her labs  which revealed a fairly significant hyponatremia    neuro  further workup included an mri c spine   that showed disc disease x   levels and she was put in a collar  despite this  her strength and respiratory status worsened         strength throughout  and she lost her reflexes  she also had lost some pinprick and cold sensation in the distal extremities and her proprioception decreased as well  nifs and fvcs were monitored closely and she was transferred to the icu for possible intubation  she was intubated     her history and exam was suggestive for an acute demyelinating polyneuropathy   an lp showed  wbc

and trace reflexes in the right triceps  left patella  absent elsewhere  with mute toes on babinski test   she was able to get out of bed to chair with assistance but was not observed walking yet   she was complaining of tingling in the finger tips  which seemed to be related to the resolving gbs    pulm  initially  for the possibility that her hyponatremia was related to siadh from small cell lung ca  and because she was complaining of  chest and back pain  a ct of the chest was performed  with contrast  both to rule out dissection of the aorta  which was negative  and to rule out lung ca   this scan revealed  multiple abnormalities in liver  enhancing  may be hemangioma or malignancy   pancreatic divisum with dilated ducts  bilateral scars  cortical  of kidneys  no pulmonary pathology  an mri was obtained  the final report was pending at discharge and should be followed up on   her blood pressure was noted to be labile  likely due to gbs  which can cause fluctuations of both heart rate and blood pressure  as well as arrhythmias  and was controlled with metoprolol    mg po ng  amlodipine  mg and hydralazine prn   at discharge  she was tolerating this regimen with no side effects

patient appeared euvolemic   by day    she had reached her nadir of      with further fluid restriction  the sodium normalized on its own  after ivig   she was felt to have siadh related to gbs  as has been documented in case reports   at discharge  the sodium remained in the     range  her renal function remained stable and she appeared to be euvolemic with normal lytes at discharge    id  upon admission  her wbc was slightly elevated   no clear source of infection was found  ua ucx  bcx  sputum and csf cultures all negative  and her wbc count resolved within a day of presentation   at

function declined throughout his hospital stay  and the patient required dialysis   the patient s decline in renal function over his baseline chronic renal insufficiency may have been due to a

to rule out ischemic event  however  the decline in cardiac function may be more consistent with a cardiomyopathy possibly due a systemic inflammatory response type syndrome in the setting of

supratherapeutic inr  worsening renal function and hyperbilirubinemia       hypotension  initial differential was sepsis vs bleed vs medication effect vs severe fluid overload and r heart failure  the patient was given increasing doses of diltiazem and started on metoprolol in the setting of liver and kidney dysfunction  however  it took longer for his hypotension to improve than would have been expected with an adverse effect of nodal agents  his hematocrit remained stable  making a recurrence of the retroperitoneal bleed unlikely  despite his rapidly rising inr  with his extreme volume overload  there was concern for r sided heart failure  however this was not supported by echocardiography  he had severe left shift on admission  raising concern for sepsis  presumably secondary to cholecystitis  notably all cultures were negative and there was also no change in his chest x ray  he was covered with eight days of empiric vancomycin and piperacillin tazobactam  he had an arterial line placed and his metoprolol and diltiazem were held  around   his pressures began to improve  likely from resolving sepsis  he became increasingly tachycardic with afib w  rvr during this same period  so his metoprolol and diltiazem were restarted       acute on chronic renal failure  likely atn in the setting of hypotension  because of concerns for fluid overload  he was started on cvvh    on   his urine output began to improve and he was no longer as fluid overloaded  so the cvvh was stopped  he was started on a lasix gtt with good response  though this was held on   when a rising white count created concern for a new septic process   he began to autodiurese towards the end of his stay  with furosemide    mg po daily for additional gentle diuresis and negative fluid balance   his resolving   will need close followup with labs at least   times weekly until stabilized       cholecystitis  diagnosed after abdominal ct   and us   showed distended gallbladder   hida scan on   was concerning for acute cholecystis   percutaneous cholecystostomy drain was placed   and antibiotics were continued   his wbc count and lfts improved   acute cholecystitis was likely the cause of his sepsis   final bile cultures were pending at time of discharge  but no organisms were seen on gram stain   he was transitioned to augmentin on   with continued improvement   per hepatology recs  the drain will need to remain in place for at least   weeks  with continued antibiotics   he will need close followup with hepatology after discharge regarding further management       hyperbilirubinemia  direct bilirubinemia of unclear cause  differential includes congestive hepatopathy vs acalculous cholecystis vs biliary obstruction  now improving with treatment of cholecystitis and conservative management   he may have an element of chronic liver disease and will need hepatology followup       ruq pain  on   the patient acutely developed ruq pain  the next day  this was accompanied by a rising wbc count  ruq u s  limited by habitus  did not show clear signs of cholecystitis  non contrast abd pelvis ct showed a large gallbladder w o clear surrounding inflammation  because wbc count continued to rise  a hida scan was done   and was positive  in this setting decision was made to intubate a patient and have ir place a percutaneous biliary drain  surgery consult felt that cholecystectomy was not required at this time  since placement of the biliary tube his wbc counts have normalized and his abdominal pain has also resolved       coagulopathy  after admission  patient had a rapidly rising inr to a maximum of       he has received a total of about    mg vitamin k  he also received a total of six units of ffp  largely in the setting of procedures  etiology is unclear but likely related to undiagnosed chronic liver disease  congestive hepatopathy  antibiotic use  or poor nutritional status   no evidence of further bleeding after the initial

intrinsic process  her urine was negative for eosinophhils   her spep and upep were negative  a renal consult was obtained and the conclusion was that her renal dysfunction was secondary to chronic kidney disease from htn and microvascular disease  for which she needs outpt followup  that was exacerbated by hypercalcemia from calcium supplements and furosemide   it was felt that she did not require a renal biopsy to help elucidate the diagnosis of sarcoid  as the sarcoid findings on biopsy are nonspecific  she was given iv fluids and diuretics as needed through her admission and her

a drug eluting stent   a  x cm heterogeneous echogenic mass is seen in close proximity congruent with the the anterior free wall of the right atrium  this  mass  appears to be somewhat contiguous with epicardial fat and does not appear to originate outside of the pericardial space or from the ivc  there is also no evidence of obstruction to rv inflow  there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function lvef       due to suboptimal technical quality  a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded  a mild    mmhg peak  mid cavitary

with preserved global biventricular systolic function  right atrial mass as described above  mild mid left ventricular dynamic gradient  if clinically indicated  a tee  chest ct or cardiac mr may be able to better define the right atrial abnormality      soft tissue thickening around the right coronary artery  probably in the epicardial space  measuring up to   cm on the myocardial side and   cm on the pericardial side  which is somewhat hyperdense on the precontrast images  given recent cardiac catheterization  appearances are most concering for epicardial hematoma  if clinically indicated confirmation and further characterization could be performed using cardiac mri     well circumscribed low density region of the superior most aspect of the ivc  without definite corresponding findings on the precontrast examination  this probably represents artifact from reflux of contrast through the ivc mixing with nonopacified contrast from the abdomen  this could be further evaluated if indicated in conjunction with cardiac mr  or alternatively abdominal ultrasound could further assess flow within the ivc     severe copd     multifocal vertebral body compression fractures     p m       additional literature review shows that epicardial hematoma is a rare entity which can be associated with regional myocardial infarction due to risk of avulsion of rca perforators  clinical correlation is required  additional comment was discussed with dr              early congestive heart failure  no evidence for pneumonia   selective coronary arteriography revealed no significant coronary artery disease  the previosuly noticed perforation in the rca is no longer present   no evidence of av fistula  pseudoaneurysm  or hematoma within the left groin      coronary artery disease  the patient had a known   vessel disease by catheterization report in    she ruled out for ami at the osh  the patient underwent cardiac catheterization on   which revealed tight stenoses in the om  and rca  the lesions were treated with rotational atherectomy and stented with taxus and cypher stents  the procedure was complicated by a localized small wire perforation of the rv marginal branch that appeared stable without visible hemodynamic sequelae during the procedure  the patient then had an echo performed which revealed an incidental finding of an abnormality in the anterior free wall of the right atrium  this was further investigated by chest cta and was characterized as an epicardial hematoma  the patient continued to be asymptomatic  however  the decision was to have her undergo a re look catheterization which she had on    repeat cath showed no significant coronary artery disease  the previously noticed perforation in the rca was no longer present  the   medical regimen

you had a large heart attack which affected the electrical system of your heart  you had a cardiac catheterization at     and two bare metal stents were placed in your right coronary artery  you will need to take plavix and aspirin every day for at least one month  do not stop taking plavix and aspirin unless dr    tells you to  you also had a pneumonia and finished a course of antibiotics on   to treat this  a pacemaker was placed at     but we did not feel you needed this long term and took it out  we think your heart rhythm is now the same as it was before the heart attack  you had some abdominal pain that was due to some blockages in your gallbladder  you have a tube that is draining bile and should stay in for   weeks  you will need to cap off the tube after   weeks and see if you develop a fever or if the pain comes back  please call   if you have any questions about the tube  you will be on antibiotics for one week to treat the infection  your kidney function worsened during

definite focal consolidation is seen  there is prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues  more evident than on the earlier study  perhaps related to degree of patient rotation   likely representing ectatic brachiocephalic vessels  impression  chf  new since     erosive change at the first mtp joint and interphalangeal joint of the left great toe  appearance is somewhat nonspecific  but could be consistent with gout or inflammatory arthropathy      no hemorrhage or mass effect     mild stable ventriculomegaly   this is an abnormal portable eeg due to the frequent spike  and sharp wave discharges seen in the frontal regions bilaterally and over the central midline  while no clear spike slow wave or sharp slow wave complexes were noted  the findings raise concern for an area of potential epileptogenesis  in addition  the background was disorganized  slow  and interrupted by bursts of generalized mixed frequency slowing  consistent with a moderate encephalopathy  this suggests dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures  medications  metabolic disturbances  and infection are among the common causes of encephalopathy  there were no areas of prominent focal slowing  although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings  there were no repetitive or sustained  discharges and no electrographic seizures were noted   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function  compared to the last study  images reviewed  of    the findings are similar   this    hour video eeg telemetry captured two sitter pushbuttons for unclear reasons which were not associated with any significant change on the patient s eeg or any significant change in the patient s appearance on video  no electrographic seizures were seen  however  interictal epileptiform discharges were seen independently from both hemispheres and from the bifrontal region simultaneously at times  but these never progressed to   electrographic seizures  the background was slow and disorganized throughout the recording suggestive of a moderate to severe encephalopathy   this telemetry captured no pushbutton activations  routine sampling shows a normal background with bursts of generalized slowing and particularly prominent slowing over the right hemisphere  this suggests a focal subcortical abnormality on the right side  nevertheless  the background remained normal in other areas and at other times  there were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures   this is a mildly abnormal    hour video eeg telemetry in the waking and sleeping states due to the bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing  this is a nonspecific finding suggestive of deep subcortical midline

hypotensive in the ed and subsequently admitted to the micu for further care    etiology is not entirely clear   he is obese and likely has some element of osa vs  hypoventilation syndrome but the degree seems more extensive to be explained by this alone   although serum and urine tox were negative for illicits  there is the possibility of overdose on psychiatric medication  as he was found down  trauma is another possible cause of his depressed mental status and hypoventilation  although no evidence of this on physical exam  head ct was negative for acute process   during micu course  the patient was successfully extubated and breathing comfortably before being called out to the medicine floor   on the floor  sleep medicine was consulted to help evaluate the patient for possible osa and to titrate nighttime bipap   he did well with this when agreeable to wearing it  he frequently refused   the patient s respiratory status rapidly improved on the floor  and he was oxygen saturation was in the mid    s on room air    stage iv ckd  creatinine elevated from previous baseline of high   low    given that he was found down  likely poor po    rhabdomyolysis  likely ischemic

unknown origin upon admission that continued during his stay   spep was negative   upep showed predominance of albumin   hyperkalemia was intermittently a concern  received kayexalate as needed   renal was reconsulted for evaluation of worsening renal status  chronic kidney disease   he is to follow up with his outpatient nephrologist about possible future hemodialysis   he was started on phosphate binders and vitamin d    as above  the differential was broad  but likely is a reflection of hypercarbia   given the degree of hypercarbia and having been found down  likely altered mental status even prior to this possibly secondary to ingestion of higher dose of his own meds vs  psychosis and subsequent fall  although no clear evidence of trauma   head ct negative and eeg without seizure activity   at the time of admission to the micu  his psychiatric medications were held   psychiatry was consulted and at time of floor transfer suggested adding back risperidone   this was done gradually  but on the second day on the floor  the patient again became somnolent   this was felt due to co  narcosis  with a contribution from medications as well    this prompted the sleep medicine consult as noted above  and bipap was begun   following this  there were no further problems with somnolence  the patient frequently refused bipap while on the medical floor   was normotensive upon presentation to ed  probable relative hypotension for him given h o poorly controlled htn   but then required levophed in ed and upon presentation to micu   etiology not entirely

insufficiency   in the micu  the patient became hypertensive   his home meds were restarted   these meds were titrated for better blood pressure control on the floor  the patient s bp was stable on

cirrhosis c b multiple gi bleeds  ckd with baseline and ongoing alcohol abuse  transferred to   for further evaluation of gi bleed   unclear source  as egd revealed no prominent active bleed  most likely sources include erosive esophagitis and duodenal varices  although these may not account for the amount of blood loss evidenced by blood counts at osh  hematemesis  melena  brisk tempo of bleeds and precipitous in counts would also be more consistent with upper gi source  he was transferred for further exploration with possible egd   vs  capsule study  with consideration of tips  based on findings  patient was hemodynamically stable  normal hr and bp  on admission to micu  with h h increased to   after massive blood product repletion at osh  on   egd showed no sign of active bleeding  severe esophagitis  moderate gastropaty and colonoscopy was unremarkable  this raised the possibility of a portal gastropathy  his cvl from osh was removed and new line placed in lij  octreotide and pantoprazole now since    octreotide discontinued on    he was started on zosyn for the possibility of an aspiration pna  see below  which also doubled as sbp prophylaxis and he completed a   day course on    capsule endoscopy on floor did not function properly  perhaps secondary to body habitus  patient thereafter monitored  with stable hematocrit for nearly   weeks thereafter as patient awaited placement in rehab  ultimately  his blood losses were thought to be secondary to gastropathy   meld    on discharge mortality over   months         secondary to alcholic liver diseases  with prior decompensations from gi bleeds and possible hrs  no known hepatic encephalopathy  ascites or variceal bleeds  patient was removed from transplant list in   for failure to keep appointments and relapse with alcohol use  octreotide  pantoprazole and zosyn were continued as above  after completion of his egd colonoscopy and following his extubation on    he was started on lactulose and rifaximin for prevention of hepatic encephalopathy  these medications were continued on discharge   patient found to have pleural effusion on cxr  per prior reports and notes  has been longstanding and likely   volume overload and was previously characterized as hepatic hydrothorax following pleural effusion analysis several months prior to admission  patient offered thoracentesis  but was initially very against the idea and declined  preferring instead to allow dialysis to take off fluid  patient ultimately agreed to the procedure  and it was performed on    extended light s criteria suggested transudative effusion  post procedure portable xr raised concern of trapped lung  but repeat pa and lateral xr was unremarkable  he may require periodic thoracentesis if fluid reaccumulates and he develops dyspnea or coughing   creatinine elevated on admission to     from baseline in the low   range  with urine electrolytes consistent with prerenal azotemia   there was concern for developing hrs  especially in setting of gi bleed  but the patient was still making urine so it was considered less likely  clincially  he was total body volume overloaded with extensive peripheral edema  patient was briefly trialed on furosemide drip  but experienced worsening creatinine and after discussion with renal it was decided to move forward with ultrafiltration in order to remove his excess fluid   l off on     thereafter  patient was initiated on hemodialysis and will continue a mwf course via his rue avf   a small pseudoaneurysm was appreciated  he was evaluated by transplant surgery who will follow him as an outpatient   on    patient developed low grade fevers  continued to cough  but cough was slightly improved s p thoracentesis mentioned above  patient also

signs of respiratory distress during the remainder of his hospitalization  on day of discharge  strep culture was noted to be resistant to pcn  however  given his marked improvement on ceftriaxone  he was continued on cefopodoxime    mg   to complete a total of    days of therapy      hemoptysis  developed shortly after extubation  possibly due to frequent coughing  trauma from recent intubation

he was trying to get high by taking all these meds rather than kill himself  lesion on neck is from strangulation during mugging rather than suicide attempt  cut on wrist was reportedly an accident while washing dishes per him and his mother  psych was consulted and saw patient  patient was initially section    with a     sitter  however  psych spoke with the patient further and decided he does

withdrawal  psychiatry and social work followed the patient closely during admission to assess for safety and suicidality  pt repeatedly reported that he was not trying to harm himself and was simply trying to get high as his girlfriend wanted to  party  on new year s for her bday  repeatedly said that the neck wound was from being strangled when he was  trying to get his girlfriend  who uses drugs  out of a crack house  he reported that wrist wound due to accidentally injury at home  psychiatry deemed that he was not a candidate for section    nor did he warrant inpatient psychiatric admission  they believed him to be in the  pre contemplative  phase  he has a scheduled appointment with an outpatient psychiatrist  soonest available      of note  pt has served alot of jail time due to drugs and his long term girlfriend uses drugs  recently  released from prison     anxiety pt reports  anxiety  as a trigger to his substance use  requests clonidine and benzos  this was no given  given pt s reported history of missuse and overdose on these substances  this was explained to patient  pt reported he uses his home neurontin for  anxiety   told patient that best option for him

cocaine use  thought to be due to acute crack lung inhalation injury   his most recent reported crack cocaine use was five days prior to admission  and his symptoms of dyspnea started   days prior to admission  which is consistent with crack cocaine pneumonitis   patient also had elevated jvp  rales on lung exam  and imaging suggestive of fluid overload  making chf exacerbation a likely diagnosis

patient was transitioned to carvedilol and discontinued the metoprolol as he is at risk for continued cocaine abuse  he remained euvolemic during his stay and was discharged without oxygen requirement   it is unclear whether patient actually has type   or type   diabetes but he has been able to go extended periods of time without medications making it more likely he has type   diabetes  due to his high steriod dosing patient had significant increases in his insulin requirements    diabetes consult was placed and assisted in dosing insulin  there was no evidence of dka while he was inpatient

a complaint of hemorrhoidal pain   initial labs suggested that she was acutely infected  lactate      anion gap acidosis  urine with wbcs and nitrites    serum etoh level was also elevated   she was admitted to the medicine service for further management     seizure activity   patient was noted on hospital day three to suffer a tonic clonic seizure   she has no prior history of seizures but she does have a history of alcohol abuse  differential diagnosis included hypertension  ethanol withdrawal versus medication induced  lidocaine toxicity versus fluoroquinolone   she had a ct head performed at that time which was negative for hemorrhage   she had an mri of the brain which also showed no acute abnormalities   lidocaine and ciprofloxacin were discontinued   she remained seizure free for the remainder of her hospital course   the etiology of her seizure remains unclear  neurology referral can be considered as an outpatient   the patient was noted to have sinus tachycardia ranging from    s to    s throughout her hospital stay  infection may be the leading explanation for the tachycardia  she presented with e coli uti as well as evidence of pneumonia on ct chest   initial concern was for toxic ingestion versus alcohol withdrawal although toxicology screens on admission were negative and she denies significant alcohol use currently  tachycardia was not responsive to benzodiazepines which argues against alcohol withdrawal   she had a normal tsh   although she did have evidence of anemia during her hospital stay her tachycardia and hematocrit did not correlate   she had a cta which was negative for pulmonary embolism   she was not in pain while tachycardic   echocardiogram was unrevealing   she was seen by cardiology who felt that her tachycardia

area for pain control  the lidocaine was stopped after her seizure   she was pain free at the time of discharge   patient may follow up as outpatient and obtain surgical consult should the hemorrhoids become an increasingly debilitating problem    on admission patient had positive urinalysis and urine culture positive for e  coli pansensitive  she completed a course of appropriate antibiotics and was symptom free at the time of discharge    patient was noted on initial ct scan to have evidence of possible atypical pneumonia   she was initially treated with ciprofloxacin but after her seizure this was transitioned to doxycycline   given the atypical nature of the findings on ct scan would recommend repeat imaging as outpatient to ensure resolution    patient was noted to have significant hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia on presentation after fluid resuscitation   malnutrition and alcohol abuse were considered in the differential although other electrolyte wasting conditions should be considered   her electrolytes were repleted aggressively and were stable at the time of discharge    patient has a history of hypertension but had self discontinued her medications   during this admission she had very labile blood pressures with diastolic pressures as high as    s   she was started on hctz    mg daily and labetalol     mg     these medications can be titrated as an outpatient

directly from clinic after presenting with a complaint of vomiting   the differential diagnosis that was generated to explain the patient s vomiting included gastric outlet obstruction  biliary

patient was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit   notable events while in the intensive care unit from   through   include acute renal failure attributed to acute tubular necrosis manifested by gradually worsening creatinine  peaking at     on   and then improving to baseline of     by the day of discharge   in the intensive care unit  the patient was also started on total parenteral nutrition   on discharge from the intensive care unit on postoperative day number five the patient was alert and oriented  tolerating ice chips and sips with medications  she was noted to be anxious and emotionally labile at times  by system  following the notable events during the rest of her hospital stay    the patient was started on an immunosuppression regimen of cellcept  cyclosporin and prednisone in the postoperative period and she was also on rapamycin briefly   the patient s liver function tests were noted to trend downward steadily   optimal cyclosporin dosing was still to be determined on the day of discharge  but it was expected with continue to monitoring cyclosporin levels following discharge   this should be completed soon   the patient is to be discharged on cyclosporin dose of     mg b i d   the patient s incision was monitored for infection in collaboration with the infectious disease service during the immediate postop period   it went from purulent drainage as noted from the unction point of her   incision  culture swabs from the incision were unremarkable and the drainage was minimal by the day of discharge   the patient was not treated with antibiotics specifically targeting this incision and dry gauze dressing was used to cover the draining area prn   the incision will need to be monitored for evidence of developing or worsening infection   the patient s post surgical abdominal pain was managed with percocet one to two tablets every four to six hours as needed for pain with good relief   the patient had some residual ascites by the date of discharge    the patient was reported to have had an episode of pancreatitis in the immediate postoperative period  but this was resolved by the time of the   transfer to the floor on postop day number five   the patient was started on a regular diet on postoperative day number five and her total parenteral nutrition was discontinued  the patient s appetite was  however  noted to be poor in the period immediately after initiation of regular diet by mouth  this was confirmed by a calorie count and the decision was made to initiate cycled tube feedings on postoperative day number eight with mepro   preference was given to a low potassium formula given the patient s hyperkalemia during that period   the patient s appetite remained marginal on the day of discharge and continued tube feeding as likely to be needed in the short term   a calorie count on the day prior to the patient s discharge revealed the patient was only meeting    of her protein needs by mouth and only     of her caloric needs    as mentioned above the patient s acute renal failure resolved steadily with serum creatinine falling from a peak of     on postoperative day number three to a baseline of about   by postoperative day number fifteen    the patient s stool tested positive for c difficile on her day of admission and   and the patient was started on treatment for this infection   by hospital day number two the day prior to surgery the patient s stool was negative for c difficile   the decision was made to keep the patient on prophylaxis against this infection following surgery to complete a fourteen day course   out of concern about the ability of her gut to adequately absorb  the patient was double covered with po vancomycin and intravenous flagyl   c difficile toxin performed on postoperative day number ten were negative   the patient s intravenous flagyl was discontinued and po vancomycin continued to postoperative day number fourteen  the patient was also on standard post transplant prophylactic antibiotics   valcyte  bactrim and fluconazole    no issues on this admission    the patient required platelet transfusion on postop day number three and seven  but by the time of discharge her platelet count was increasing   the patient required transfusions for decreases in hematocrit on postop day number fourteen and seventeen   the patient was evaluated for a source of bleeding  none could be identified   her stool was guaiac negative   the patient s hematocrit will need to be monitored following discharge    the patient s blood glucose levels were controlled with insulin on a sliding scale   her insulin requirements were noted to be increasing on postoperative day number thirteen through fourteen   her sliding scale coverage was increased and the   clinic consult team was asked to see her   their recommendations included placing the patient on six units of nph at breakfast and dinner and continued the use of sliding scale insulin  the patient s diabetic teaching was deferred for fear of overwhelming the patient   it is believed that the patient s current high blood glucose may be attributable to some of her immunosuppressive medications and may resolve in two to three months   arrangements were made for the patient to visit the   clinic for appointments on days to coincide with her visits to the   transplant center   tsh level was noted to increase from     on   to    on   and ultimately to    on     the cause for the increase in tsh was unclear  but thyroid function tests were drawn on the day prior to admission and follow up is expected from the   clinic   the patient was started on a minimal dose of synthroid at       mg q d  to be discontinued if this medication is deemed unnecessary    the patient was seen by physical therapy following transfer to the floor from the intensive care unit and with therapy the patient was ultimately able to ambulate safely and independently on the floor with a walker  it is anticipated that she will continue to receive physical therapy following discharge    the patient was noted to be hypokalemic with serum potassium in the   to   range from postoperative day number eight through fifteen  requiring use of kayexalate twice during that period  and administration of lasix with the duel purpose of treating hyperkalemia and assisting in diuresis of the patient   the patient was stable on telemetry during the period of highest serum potassium  the etiology for the hyperkalemia was unclear  although it was believed that the patient s ongoing treatment with fluconazole  cyclosporin and vancomycin were contributing factors   the patient s potassium was down to within normal limits by the day of discharge   the patient was also started on     mg of magnesium by mouth twice a day when her magnesium levels were noted to be trending downward   her magnesium levels will need to be monitored following discharge    the patient was at times noted to be anxious and emotionally labile by staff  intermittent crying episodes  expressions of frustration and difficulty coping   neuro psychiatric evaluation was requested prior to the patient s discharge   findings from evaluation included the fact that the patient had deficits in memory  visual planning and organization as well as flexibility of attention and naming and as such is prone to confusion

remained stable until around      when her bp again began to decrease  a     ml ns bolus was given without response and phenylephrine was started at this point  also at around this time her oxygen

change in mental status  it is unclear if the patient is now far from his baseline though reportedly he does speak a few words  it is conceivable that he was less responsive during his hypoxic episode  he was treated for  aspiration  pneumonia with resolution   mri was normal and eeg did not show any seizure activity  lfts were wnl and tox screen was negative  tsh was elevated but free t  normal so no thyroid replacement  b   folate wnl  neurology consulted and recommended continuing with medical regimen   question of normal pressure hydrocephalus on ct  prior films were not available for comparison so chronicity unknown  but per neurology  patient not candidate for shunt placement and no furhter intervention recommended at this time   of note  he did have an episode of decreased

subsequently  however     note  all compuations above were performed using an assumed vo  and not a measured vo   measurement of vo  is not possible with our current equipment while patient is on supplemental oxygen  the patient had fluctuating levels of arousal during the procedure  ranging from awake and asking questions to sound asleep snoring  if the patient is more sedated  with vo      ml min m    then the pvr will be artifactually low  and more sedated  with vo      ml min m    then the pvr will be artifactually high  and actually lower than computed   in addition  during all r lhc measurements  although the  pcw  waveform often looked reasonable  there was a small end diastolic gradient between  pcw  and lv suggestingve of mitral stenosis  during the milrinone phase  the   port and   port transducers were swapped  and the apparent end diastolic gradient persisted  indicating that this was an artifact of the   transducers  the oxygen saturation drawn with the pwp in the  pcw  position was only      indicating mixture of   and catheter position not truly in pcw  despite multiple attempts to get pwp distally  with often large loops in the rv   thus  the pcw measured is likely to be somewhat higher than the true pcw  with pa diastolic pressure entrained at end diastole   which results in an artifactually low pvr   and actually higher than computed   thus  the computed co  ci and pvr are not likely to be entirely accurate and should be interpreted with caution     left ventriculography not preformed  clockwise rotated heart  calcified aortic knob      two

hypertension with some fluctuations in baseline values     severe biventricular diastolic heart failure     slight improvement in pasp and mean pa with addition of o  and milrinone  with apparent decrease in pvr due solely to apparent increase in co  but interpretation of these are confounded by inablility to get the pwp into a good pcw position and by fluctuations in the patient s level of arousal  which determines actual vo   which was assumed to be unchanged throughout  and the vo  drives the pvr computation      no evidence of right to left shunting     sheaths to be removed

with large volume ascites  an elevated jvp and a worsening r sided pleural effusion   he underwent a l r heart catheterization which demonstrated elevated filling pressures in the presence of stable

patient s cr was elevated at     upon admission and fluctuated with diuresis   it was hypothesized that the elevation in his cr was secondary to long standing congestion due to a chronically increased

edematous bowel  both small and large  floating within it  bowel also notable for hyperemia  as noted throughout the gi tract  no definite free air is seen within the pelvis  air is noted within the

wall edema and portal triad edema  a precise etiology for the ascites and bowel wall edema is not identified     p m  on        cxr    there has been interval extubation and removal of a nasogastric tube  a right subclavian vascular catheter continues to cross the midline into the left brachiocephalic vein rather than coursing within the superior vena cava  the mediastinal contours appear slightly increased in the interval but may be accentuated by the degree of rightward patient rotation  vascular crowding related to low lung volumes likely account for the accentuated appearance of the perihilar vasculature  however  it is difficult to exclude a component of mild volume overload  bilateral hazy opacity suggests the possibility of layering effusions on this semi erect study  note is made of obscuration of the periphery of the left hemidiaphragm which appears more prominent than on the previous exam  previously noted left retrocardiac opacity appears less prominent      decreased left retrocardiac opacity  which may relate to a resolving area of atelectasis or pneumonia  there remains obscuration of the peripheral left hemidiaphragm  which may be due to left pleural effusion and possibly a focal area of atelectasis or pneumonia in this area     persistent malpositioning of right subclavian vascular catheter  coursing into the left brachiocephalic vein      cxr    findings   right cvl in the same place as prior study  lungs are clear       assessment   this is a    year old female who presents with severe dka   she has a history of multiple admissions in the past for dka with the most recent being      the patient was admitted to the emergency department and was severely acidemic on admission with initial ph of      and a bicarbonate of     the patient was intubated for hyperventilation and received   amps of bicarbonate during resuscitation   she then received twelve liters of normal saline and was started on insulin drip   cause of her severe dka on this admission was unclear   ct scan of the abdomen was performed on admission which showed diffuse edema and question of an infiltrate on the chest ct   the patient also had elevated lfts in the       s on admission  which then trended down after resuscitation   she was extubated two days after admission and was weaned off the insulin drip three days after admission   the patient was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin that afternoon and her gap closed by      p m   the patient was transferred to the medicine floor after her anion gap closed and continued to do well   the patient was followed by   who made specific recommendations for her sliding scale with glargine   at the time of discharge  the patient was continued on her    units of glargine at night in addition to her sliding scale which was altered based on the patient s daily fingersticks   the patient s potassium and phosphate were aggressively repleted  the patient was tolerating p o  s by hospital day    and was out of diuresing   she required no further iv hydration after starting p o  s    the cause of her dka was unclear   the patient states that she felt nauseous and had an episode of vomiting prior to losing consciousness   however  of note  she denies fevers  upper respiratory symptoms  and other sick exposures   it is unclear how long the patient was down   however  based on labs on admission  it appears that the patient was down for an extended period of time        hypotension   when the patient was admitted to the emergency department  her blood pressure was in the    systolic  differential diagnosis at that time included sepsis  hyperthermia  cardiac ischemia  adrenal insufficiency  and hypovolemia   the patient did not require pressors in the micu  but did receive twelve liters of normal saline and three units of packed red blood cells   in the icu  the patient s sputum was cultured and was positive for staph  aureus coag  positive   she was therefore started on vancomycin   further speciation showed that the staph  aureus was sensitive to oxacillin   however  patient s respiratory symptoms had completely resolved and therefore she was not continued on antibiotics as it was felt that this was the contaminant and the patient was colonized with staph  aureus  follow up cxr was clear as well  the patient s stool cultures were all negative for c  diff and blood cultures were all negative   urine cultures were negative as well   the patient s cardiac enzymes were cycled in the micu for possible cardiac ischemia and these were negative   the cortisol skin test results were performed and adrenal insufficiency was ruled out   the patient s blood pressure stabilized after fluid resuscitation and normalization of her blood sugars        metabolic acidosis   this is most likely secondary to dka on admission and resolved on transfer to the medicine floor        acute renal failure   again  this is likely due to both volume depletion and poor fluid flow given that the patient was down for an extended period of time   on admission  her creatinine was       this resolved back to her baseline of     on discharge   the patient had good urine output with no further evidence of renal failure on discharge        abdominal distention   after resuscitation  patient s abdominal distention resolved   the markedly edematous colon that was seen on the initial ct was likely to be due to third spacing secondary to shock   the patient was having normal bowel movements by the time of discharge        transaminitis and elevated inr   again  this was thought to be secondary to shock liver   the patient s transaminitis resolved by the time of discharge and inr was back down to baseline of          social   patient has had twelve admissions to the icu over the past two years with dka   therefore  both social work and case management became involved as on this admission  the patient was home alone with her   year old son   dss was contact  as it was felt that the patient would be unable to care for her son  if she was unable to care for herself at home   the purpose of contacting dss was to allow for the patient to gain additional services in order to help care for her son so that she can take better care of her own health   a family meeting was called with the patient s mother and three aunts  this was explained extensively and also explained the details of the patient s illness and the need to keep her extremely healthy   this past admission  the patient may not have survived  if she had not been resuscitated within an hour of finding her   the resolution after this family meeting was that the patient s godmother will move in with the patient to help her care for her son and for herself   the godmother and another family member will also accompany the patient to all appointments   the patient will try to attend all of her appointments or reschedule appointments as needed   the patient will also meet with a nutritionist at   and attend support group meetings as needed   dss will come to the patient s house to assess the living situation and service options   the patient was given a sliding scale and will be seen by   today after discharge to review her findings again   the patient was instructed to keep a log of all of her blood sugars for her appointment   both the family and the patient seemed very

which details events from          and        initial admission surgical course patient was admitted to dr   surgical service on    in short  the patient is a    year old gentleman who was discharged   days ago prior after a month long hospitalization for bilateral acute thalamic strokes  he has had   days of abdominal pain and poor p o  intake  he now presents after evaluation at an outside hospital that showed a significant amount of free air on an upright chest x ray  upon house staff examination  decision was made to take patient to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy for probable perforated viscus  during operation  upon entering the abdomen  it was noted that the patient had a distended perforated cecum  it was thinned out and ischemic area on the antimesenteric wall of the cecum with his perforation in the ischemic area  the cecum itself was large and patulous and the perforation was partially walled off with omentum against the right lateral sidewall  there were feculent contents in the peritoneal fluid throughout the abdomen  indicating prior free perforation which had walled off  there was no evidence of gastric or duodenal injury  the sigmoid colon was normal as was the transverse colon and the small bowel  the liver on palpation was also normal  the decision was then made to continue with a right hemicolectomy  end ileostomy and hartmann s pouch  blood loss was     ml and patient resuscitated with almost   liters of crystalloids  patient tolerated the procedure and there were no complications to the operation  he was immediately transferred to

secondary to mrsa pneumonia and mucus plug   he developed tachypnea  o  sats   s on bipap    s on facemask    s nrb and hr    s on arrival to unit  sats on arrival to unit were       on nrb  he desatted to low   s in icu and was intubated with etomidate and succinylcholine  two to   minutes later  pt went into v tach arrest  he was successfully resuscitated    on   weaned off pressors   continued on antibiotics  micu course        pt was admitted to micu    following transfer from ticu during which he suffered a cardiac arrest  the pt was intubated and sedated on arrival for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure thought to be secondary to mucous plugging  the patient was weaned off the vent over the course of his first day and was subsequently extubated without complications  the pt was placed on scoop mask and subsequently transferred to the floor with a    l o  requirment    in addition the patient was also initially treated for a likely mrsa pna given fevers and increased sputum  cxr was without supporting evidence  sputum cultures grew mrsa however it was felt that this was likely a tracheo bronchitis rather than a true pna    the patient had a known intrabdominal abcess for which surgery had placed a drain  cultures had previously confirmed vre however the pt had never been treated with antibiotics  i d  was consulted and in conjunction with surgery a plan was made to continue treating with iv linezolid for a duration of    days post the plugging of the surgical drain  once it is deemed to no longer be draining adequate ammounts     the pt was also noted to have an enterococcal uti in the setting of vancomycin use  this was treated concurrently with linezolid    the pt has a stage iii iv sacral decub  this likely required further imaging and a plastic consult  further imaging was not able to be obtained while the patient was intubated in the unit  however this information was conveyed to the floor team at the time of transfer    the pt has a hx of smv thrombosis  the patient presented to the micu with a supratherapeutic inr in the setting of coumadin and levaquin use  the patients coumadin was initially held  but restarted the date of transfer from the unit    the patient has a hx of extremely labile sugars  during the patients stay in the micu  the pts tube feeds were at sub goal levels  the patient had one episode of fs    with hypotension to the   s  and received   amps of d    the patients fixed lantus and sliding scales were adjused prior to his transfer from the unit  recommendations were made to the transfer team for   to consult on the pt       medicine course              the patient was transferred to the floor on   during which time his mental status began to clear  he had been intermittently oriented to   and could discuss the    plastics was consulted for the patient s stage iii sacral decub  who noted that the decub is extending to the sacral fascia but not to the bone  and recommended wound debridement  packing  and continuing linezolid  he received multiple debridements of a sacral ulcer that had been present since his original surgery  a wound culture from   grew e coli and enterococcus and zosyn was added to his regimen on        pt triggered   for rr    s   s     on  l  pt was afebrile at the time  and hemodynamically stable  and abg normal with                  it was thought it was likely   mucous plugging  cxr did show possible retrocardiac infiltrate but without cough and white count aspiration pna or hap is unlikely  pt s respiratory rate came down after nebs  and humidifying face mask on fio      pt does have sleep apnea with bipap at home and maybe a possiblity  we held off on bipap cpap since pt still at high risk for aspiration  subsequent cxrs in the following days were negative  and pt remained stable on ra  and no futher episodes of triggers until day of transfer to micu on         concerning the pt s anemia  iron studies c w acd  ferritin      iron      pt had prior transfusion with hct   s  pt s hct dropped to      on    and received  u prbc on the    pt remained guaic neg per ostomy  pt also of italian descent   g pd consideration  which was negative  prior to coming to the floor pt s factor v lieden  and prothrombin mutation were also negative  pt was continued on coumadin for his smv thrombosis  and it was not clear to neuro what caused the smv thrombosis and the thalamic strokes in the first place  on his prior admisison   pt s coumadin did become subthereapeutic at one point  and pt was started on heparin to be continued until he became therapeutic again       concerning the patient s mental status his delirium initially when he came to the floor improved  once there was some improvement and pt was able to communicate neuro was consulted  who did not believe the pt has anoxic brain injury   cardiac arrest  instead pt s delerium   infections and hospital setting likely bring out the cognitive defects associated with his thalamic stroke causing his decrescendo speech  they also recommended to place his eye glasses and alternating eye patch for his diploplia   stroke to help with delirium      also pt s dm was well controlled  with   following  and at no point did the pt become hypoglycemic  and his lantus was up titrated  his ventral hernia continued to slowly heal      concerning his percutaneous drain  general surgery s recommendation was to remove the drain after   h of scant drainage  to ensure that this was the case the pigtail was flushed with  cc    flushed well  and continued to not have drainage  surgery then was called  who agreed  and then pulled the drain  tube was removed on   after      h of   cc drainage      pt was developing low grade fevers of    axillary  so pt s standing order of tylenol  g q  was d c  on    the patient developed fevers to          standard infectious work up was negative with unchanged cxr  negative blood cultures  and u a with only yeast  the foley was changed but continued to grow only yeast  id was consulted and zosyn was changed to meropenem out of concern for drug fever on    with urine eos   however  the patient continued to have fevers  furthermore meropenem was kept on to treat the sacral decub infection presumptively for sacral osteomyelitis  the linezolid was continuing to treat possible mrsa and vre      the evening of    the patient had an episode of tachypnea to the   s without new hypoxia or acidosis on abg  which resolved by morning  on   since the patient continued to have intermittent fevers the only remaining source was that the pt may have reaccumulated his intraabdominal abscess or developed a new abscess  he was sent for a repeat ct torso  this showed a large and worsened phlegmon at the site of the previous pigtail with a new fluid collection  upon returning from ct  he was tachycardic to the    s    s  sinus  and tachypnic with worsened abdominal pain  surgery was called but felt his abdomen did not require surgical intervention  he received  l ns and   mg po vitamin k for a potential ir drainage procedure in the am  he denied chest pain  worsened sob  n v  he was not hypotensive and an abg confirmed the lack of acidosis  pt was then transferred to the micu for closer monitering  and had replacement of intrabdominal drain by ir the next day   upon arrival to micu  he was tachycardic  hypotensive with drop in hct  he was transfused prbc  ct abdomen did not reveal any new bleeding and showed fluid collection  jp placed by ir for drainage phlegmon  he remained hemodynamically stable and he was transferred back to floor       medicine course organized by problem      sacral decubitus ulcer osteomyelitis  while on the floor  patient was continued on meropenem and linezolid for presumed osteomyelitis for a sacral decubitus ulcer that extends to bone  he will complete a   week course of these antibiotics on    he had bleeding from this ulcer which resulted in a hematocrit drop and he was transfused  plastic surgery also saw him at this time and sutured part of the wound that was bleeding  they did not perform any more debridements due to risk of bleeding while on anticoagulation but recommended   to tid wet to dry dressing changes  they did not feel he was a candidate for vac dressing  his heparin drip was held for   days while we ensured his hematocrit remained stable and he no longer required transfusions  two weeks prior to discharge  it was noted that he had some surrounding area of skin breakdown with eshar formation  plastics was reconsulted on   and saw the wound but did not have any further recommendations other than continuing dressing changes  they saw patient and examined wound on day of discharge and recommended wet to dry dressing changes with   x approx    week then follow up with plastic surgery in clinic  plastic surgery follow up was arranged at earliest possible appointment    smv thrombosis  cva  heparin was initially held x     days when patient had bleed from sacral decubitus ulcer  once hematocrit was stable and he did not have any further episodes of bleeding  heparin drip was restarted since benefits of anticoagulation outweighed risks  he was bridged to coumadin  he did not have any further episodes of bleeding while on anticoagulation  he will likely need lifelong anticoagulation given venous and arterial clots and should have inr followed closely on coumadin with goal inr    regarding his double vision from cva  neurology recommended alternating eye patches which the patient did not like wearing  they felt his visual problems should improve with time    intra abdominal abscess  for his intra abdominal abscess  e  coli  vre  repeat ct was obtained which did not show any new collections  his rlq jp drain was removed in early   and he did not subsequently spike a fever  show any signs of recurrent infection  or have any abdominal pain    dm    for his type   diabetes  he was continued on lantus which was uptitrated for improved glycemic control and he was continued on humalog sliding scale with good glycemic control    anemia  patient had a chronic anemia which was consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation with elevated ferritin  he did not have any further episodes of bleeding x   weeks prior to discharge and hematocrit remained stable    hematuria candiduria  he had some hematuria in early   which was felt to be secondary to foley trauma and resolved after foley was removed  at time of discharge  he was using urinal  hematocrit remained stable  patient completed   day course of diflucan for fever and candiduria  from   to       peripheral lesions  on    patient developed black lesion on tongue and right  rd digit which was initially tender  it was most likely secondary to trauma from fingersticks and possible tongue biting but there was concern for septic emboli  he did not have any signs or symptoms of infection with no fever  no elevated wbc  and no new murmurs  tte was obtained which did not show any vegetations  lesion on tongue resolved and lesion on finger was no longer tender at time of discharge  id was consulted and did not believe lesion was consistent with septic emboli  blood and mycolytic cultures were obtained on   and showed no growth at time of discharge  also  despite patient s multiple infections  he never had bacteremia or positive blood cultures    fen  multiple multidisciplinary family meetings were held to discuss various issues including nutrition  the patient s mental status had improved  he was oriented x   and was judged to be competent to make his own decisions  peg tube placement was recommended for nutrition given risks of sinusitis and infection with ngt but pt declined and preferred to keep dobhoff ngt  he was discharged on tube feeds via dobhoff  he was regularly seen by speech and swallow therapy who helped him with swallowing exercises and therapy  they recommended performing daily supervised

aspiration and malnourishment  on ppn who presented from rehab with increased somnolence    micu course    the patient reportedly was more lethargic and tachypneic at rehab and was intubated in the ed for airway protection   he had a head ct that was negative for acute process   his somnolence was thought to be from systemic infection given the patient was not on sedating medications  ekg appeared baseline  and there were no gross electrolyte abnormalities   sources of infection were presumed initially to be pneumonia within stable right pleural effusion and or cholecystitis given ct abdomen that showed distended gall bladder and ruq u s that confrimed distended gallbladder containing sludge   ua and blood cultures were negative   the patient was started on vanc zosyn to cover for hap and cholecystitis   surgery was consulted and did not think the patient had cholecystitis given his ct abdomen looked similar to ct from   and thought the findings could be due to lack of po intake on tpn   they recommended hida scan which was inconclusive  the patient s abdominal exam remained stable and he was not felt to have had cholecystitis  the patient did not exhibit septic physiology and did not require iv fluids or pressors to maintain urine output and blood pressure   he did not have elevated wbc or fevers   sputum was sent for culture and grew sensation gram negative rods  and he was switched to ceftriaxone on   and finished an   day course   due to rue dvt  he was taken down to ir for replacement l sided picc but b l ue dvts were discovered and piccs were exchanged for b l midline ivs  the right midline  older midline  was removed on     his mental status improved on minimal sedation    intubation   the patient was intubated for airway protection in the setting of altered mental status   he was noted to have some mild white secretions   he has a history of aspiration and had previously been npo   his vent settings were weaned to minimal support   he was sedated initially with fent midax but this was changed to propofol as he was expected to be extubated soon   he was extubated on   for approx   hours after aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt  he was reintubated later that day for poor oxygenation  difficulty clearing secretions and increased work of breathing  ip evaluated the patient for trach   according to goals of care discussion with hcp and patient  they placed trach   on     his vent settings were weaned and he was started on pressure support   trache collar was attempted on   and continued through the day until discharge on     sutures should be removed at   weeks from   on     trache was placed for airway protection for secretions so plan would be to keep it in for that reason and if anything decrease size  valve can be attempted for speech upon discharge   both line associated however still has left midline in place   lovenox was started as above  discharge with plan to transition to coumadin given atrial fibrillation   the patient was noted to have a right sided pleural effusion which had been present on chest x rays seince     he was not noted to be hypoxic  but thought to be in respiratory distress at rehab  his abg did not indicate he had a large a a gradient   his effusions were thought to be a combination of chf with recent aspiration pneumonia  but a superimposed pneumonia could not be ruled out   he was started on vanc zosyn as above to empirically cover for pneumonia  he was on a lasix drop on       he was changed to the equivalent home dose of his lasix on   at   mg daily  his electrolytes should be checked on   to ensure stability and assess need for replacement      malnutrition  patient wanted   tube last admission in setting of severe aspiration  however  he subsequently pulled out g tube  he has also pulled multiple piccs placed for tpn  plan was for repeat swallow eval on monday with reconsideration of goals of care pending the results   the patient was intubated for airway protection and extubated on   briefly before being reintubated for airway protection   work of breathing and increased secretions  he was given ppn  ngt was attempted but was unable to be placed   turbinate swelling  discussion with hcp regarding   tube resulted in ip consult for trach   placement      atrial fibrilation  patient currently intermittantly v paced  he received lidocaine in the ed for

possible procedure and he was on a heparin drip  lovenox was restarted on        schf  the patient appeared euvolemic and was not hypotensive  he was on a lasix gtt for several days and changed to lasix through the   tube on    he was restarted on aspirin at    mg daily given the addition of lovenox to his regimen  he was restarted on beta blocker with metoprolol tartrate on      inhibitor

bleeding fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor  he was then transferred to the micu  the following issues were addressed at this admission   pt has chronically low bp with sbp   s   s ues and    s    s les but bp on arrival to floor was found to be    d in lue and     l  in retrospect  this may have been a false measurement as pt was mentating at baseline throughout and le bps on arrival to the micu measured back at baseline  his hypotension was felt to be multifactorial  related to his underlying renal disease  blood loss from his fistula  chronic diarrhea  and bacteremia  cultures from admission ultimately grew two species of enterococcus   he had a normal cortisol level of    from his prior admission in early      this was not repeated  elevated lactate to     supported a role for sepsis bacteremia  he was treated with   l of ivf initially  placed on midodrine  and treated with antibiotics for presumed sepsis  he received daptomycin as initial cultures grew gram positive cocci  ultimately enterococcus  and the patient was known to be swab positive for vre in the past  surveillence cultures from   forward were negative at the time of death  blood pressures initially returned to baseline at   s    s in lower extremities   however  he was no longer able to tolerate dialysis  as any attempt at dialysis was complicated by severe hypotension and altered mental status  even with midodrine and albumin   when he again became hypotensive at dialysis    cefepime was added to his antibiotics and he was transferred back to the icu where he was again given small boluses of fluid   when he was transferred back to the floor with stable pressures  but now with sbps in the   s  it was decided that he would be dnr dni and we would not re attempt dialysis unless it was absolutely indicated   over the next week  the team met repeatedly with the patient s partner  mr     his family and palliative care   the decision was made to make the patient comfort measures only on     he passed away peacefully the next morning   blood cultures from the day of admission were positive for e  faecalis and e  faecium as above  both organisms grew from only one bottle  raising the possibility that this may have been a contaminant  however  patient was treated based on overall clinical picture  patient received daptomycin given history of  vre colonization  and e  faecium indeed speciated as vanco resistant  picc line was pulled in setting of presumed infection and tip was cultured though showed no growth  patient was afebrile during this admission  with maximum leukocytosis to      on admission trending down to     at discharge  lactate was elevated to     but trended down to     by    patient will continue on daptomycin dosed qhd  with an initial plan to complete a two week course   when he became repeatedly hypotensive at dialysis  the daptomycin was continued     he had a rapidly rising inr with concern for dic   his antibiotics were broadened and he was given ffp   he initially improved  but later had refractory hypotension as mentioned above   pt presented with his second episode of bleeding from av fistula in his last   hd sessions  he was seen by transplant surgery in ed and they felt bleeding had resolved  he underwent fistulogram which did not show abnormality  final read still pending at time of discharge   his hct trended down slightly from his baseline in the   s to      but he showed no further evidence of active bleeding  his inpatient hd sessions did not result in complications from fistula bleeding      chronic diarrhea  etiology unclear  this has been an ongoing issue and is in the process of outpatient work up  patient was empirically treated for cdiff when chronic diarrhea worsened and he had a new white count  he was started on flagyl with a planned    day course with improvement in his diarrhea   he later had some fecal incontinence with repeated bouts with small amounts of liquid stool   his diarrhea improved as his oral intake dropped off      gastric distension  the patient had increasing abdominal distension   and kub showed a very large gastric bubble  he did not have any pain and his abdominal exam remained benign  as he only experienced a sensation of fullness   an ng tube was placed   and he was made npo with improvement in his symptoms   tpn was not given because he was not able to get dialysis   the ng tube was clamped and removed   and he was able to tolerate small amounts of food      sacral decubitus ulcers  the patient was seen by the

was observed during the procedure  at the time of ercp  it was thought that mirrizi s syndrome was the etiology of his biliary obstruction  and the gi team recommended a percutaneous cholecystostomy

thereafter   she is not being discharged on diuretics in order to allow further recovery of her renal function   it has been observed that she naturally diureses when her hr is over     thus her

  abdominal examination revealed that bowel sounds were present  it was soft  nontender  nondistended  no evidence of rebound or guarding   peripheral vascular examination was within normal limits    the patient had a noncontrast head ct on   that was reported as normal ct of the head   she had a ct with contrast on   which showed no evidence of pulmonary emboli  small pleural effusions  marked cardiomegaly  an undrained pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy since her prior ct examination on   that showed no acute evidence of infarction or metastatic disease   there was some evidence of chronic small vessel ischemia and otherwise reported as normal    this is a    year old woman with a complex past medical history including depression with suicidal ideation  psychosis  congestive heart failure     mr  restrictive lung disease  reactive airway disease  severe kyphoscoliosis  apparent stable pulmonary nodule  vocal cord paralysis  who was initially admitted on   to     for depression and suicidal ideation   while on the psychiatric floor  she developed acute respiratory distress on   and was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit intubated for apparent episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure   following normalization of respiratory status  she was actually transferred back to     for continued management of her depression  suicidal ideation  and psychosis   again while on     she developed a second episode of respiratory distress  this time believed to be hypoxic respiratory failure  and unresponsiveness   the etiology of the patient s unresponsiveness during her second medical intensive care unit admission remains unclear  though it was believed to be secondary to a possible seizure   the patient has a history of a chronic subdural hematoma   she has been on multiple antipsychotic medications  possibly decreasing her seizure threshold and in the setting of hypoxia  had a probable seizure per neurology and per the results of the eeg    the patient was initially admitted for depression with suicidal ideation and found to be psychotic and tried on multiple medical regimens in       her course was complicated by two episodes of respiratory failure and intensive care unit admissions   at this point in time  her psychiatric regimen has been simplified to include risperdal   mg p o  q h s  and risperdal      mg p o  b i d  p r n  for agitation  anxiety  and psychosis   the patient has a severe response to benzodiazepines causing severe somnolence  and given her past history of seizures  avoidance of typical antipsychotics has been suggested per neurology  as they can lead to a decrease in seizure threshold   at the current time  her psychiatric status is much improved   she does not appear overtly depressed   she intermittently has abnormal thought process  though seems to return to baseline relatively quickly   of note  her mental status seems to correlate rather closely with her medical condition  as she becomes more hypoxic or has increased respiratory rate and appears to be laboring  her mental status deteriorates significantly   once her respiratory rate and her congestive heart failure are managed appropriately  she also returns to her baseline  which is then an engaging  conversant    year old female   consequently at this time  medications that are being held include digoxin  haloperidol  antidepressants  and other antipsychotics per psychiatry  sparing risperdal  and it would be recommended that if any additional medications are added  they would be done so via psychiatric consultation   the most recent psychiatric recommendations from   are to increase the risperdal to     mg p o  q h s  and     mg p o  q a m   in the future it also has been recommended that the patient consider a trial of aricept starting at   mg p o  q a m  which may help with delusions and also may help improve her baseline mild dementia    the patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure on this admission  one believed to be hypercarbic respiratory failure  the second believed to be hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to unresponsiveness and a probable seizure   at this time  and on discharge her respiratory status is stable   she is saturating well on room air or one to two liters nasal cannula in the         range   she has required minimal usage of her nebulizers for her asthma  which apparently is well controlled at this point in time   in retrospect  it does not appear that she has a significant component of hypercarbia  and maintaining her o  saturations at greater than     at this time is feasible and is recommended   at this stage  fluctuations in respiratory status seem more related to her congestive heart failure and severe    mr and consequently becoming fluid overloaded in the setting of worsening congestive heart failure   in terms of direct management of her respiratory disease  it is recommended that she continue on bipap at night with o  during the day as needed to maintain her saturations at greater than         to continue nebulizers for reactive airway disease   she will need to be followed up within three to six months in pulmonary clinic for a repeat cat scan on her apparently stable pulmonary nodule  left lower lobe  and she will additionally need follow up with a sleep study for obstructive sleep apnea    the patient has a history of severe mr  ejection fraction of     with    mr  and has evidence of a right lobe effusion that responds well to diuresis   she has been treated with lasix during the hospital stay for fluid management with goal i s and o s negative   she currently is on lasix    mg p o  b i d  and appears stable on this current regimen   her cardiologist is dr     who has been following her case closely in the hospital   we are continuing lisinopril    mg p o  q d  for afterload reduction and ventricular remodeling   she continues on lopressor    mg p o  t i d  and she continues to have a low sodium  heart healthy diet   it should be noted that if the patient does develop acute respiratory distress it is probably secondary to volume overload in the setting of    mr and it is recommended that a chest x ray be performed and diuresis as needed to remove any extra fluid    on   the patient developed a rapid tachyarrhythmia consistent with atrial fibrillation  rate was up into the    s to    s   systolic blood pressures remained greater than       she also had associates st depressions in multiple leads        v  through v   which were thought to be rate related   an etiology for atrial fibrillation is unknown at this time  however it was thought to be secondary to aggressive diuresis in the setting of respiratory distress and congestive heart failure management  the patient was diuresed aggressively and was      liters over approximately four hours following    mg iv lasix   the patient returned to   sinus rhythm within    hours and consequently was not anticoagulated   an ep consultation was obtained  recommending the patient start amiodarone therapy  the initial recommendations were for     mg p o  t i d  x   week      mg p o  b i d  x   week  followed by     mg p o  q d   liver function tests and tsh were normal   pulmonary function tests were obtained in the past   the patient is currently on telemetry and will need a holter monitor  i e     of hearts  monitor for two weeks  duration  until the amiodarone taper is complete   the patient remains in normal sinus rhythm at this time with no additional episodes of atrial fibrillation    following the episode of tachyarrhythmia  the patient was ruled out for an myocardial infarction in the setting of st related depressions in the setting of rapid atrial fibrillation   it was thought to be rate related   the patient had a troponin level of      down to      and it remains in that area and was thought not to be due to demand ischemia but rather related to her chronic congestive heart failure   patient remains on a beta blocker  aspirin  and ace inhibitor   her ekg has returned to her baseline without current st depressions or signs of ischemia    the patient has had evidence of metabolic alkalosis following diuretic use   it is believed to be a contraction alkalosis   her bicarbonate rose from    to    in the setting of    mg and    mg of iv lasix over the course of a week   she is currently on    mg p o  b i d  lasix and her bicarbonate now is in the low to mid   s and has remained stable over the past few days   recommendations would be to hold lasix if needed  as bicarbonate approaches       the patient is on a cardiac low sodium diet and has had her electrolytes repleted as necessary during the hospital course   there are no active issues at this time    the patient s code status has changed multiple times on admission     the most recent attending note dated    the patient s code status is now considered full code  however there is

secretions from her trach    given pt s low grade fever  leukocytosis  and new productive cough  most likely diagnosis is pneumonia  she was started on zosyn and vancomycin for a possible nosocomial pneumonia  her sputum was postive for pseudomonas  she required ventilation via her trach to keep her oxygenation up  initially she required high fio  on the ventoilator to maintain oxygenation  she was also treated with nebulizers and albuteral inhalers prn and tiatroprium  she continued to produce white sputum  on   she tolerated being of the ventilator for   hours  on day of discharge she was

pneumonia uti with completion on   prior to discharge   cxr on   with worsening right sided opacities  which we attributed to recurrent aspiration  and after discussing with son  we began shift of

as recent tte showed ef     and cxr also had some small effusions on   so did not want to push her into acute chf exacerbation  given gentle ivfs on medical floor with fluctuation in sodium levels  at

assay was negative  per hematology she is still at moderate risk for true hit so she was treated as such and all heparin products were avoided   she became therapeutic    inr so fondaparinux was discontinued but there was some overlap of effects and she had several days of supratherapeutic inr  plan per hematology was to continue her coumadin for a total of   months  but in setting of supratherapeutic inr and recent decision by son to shift goals of care to symptom management  will need to readdress coumadin reinitiation with hospice team  she was discharged off coumadin  she will follow up with pcp      after discharge for additional management      anemia  thrombocytopenia  initially attributed to bone marrow suppression due to infection  no signs of hemolysis on labs  dic labs negative  hit ab positive so heparin induced thrombocytopenia was felt to be main cause of her dropping platelets  levels returned to   ranges after heparin discontinued which further corroborates this diagnosis  however serotonin release assay was negative  per hematology she still had moderate likelihood of true hit so she should therefore avoid all heparin products in future  patient had briefly been on argatroban in the micu while team sorted out her diagnosis  on the medical floor she was placed on pneumoboots for le dvt prevention but as noted above she unfortunately developed a rue dvt  briefly bridged with fondaparinux and started coumadin  all platelet levels remained normal prior to discharge  anemia baseline unclear as she had never before been hospitalized here at   so no labs to compare to  however  iron studies done and she likely has mixed picture of anemia of chronic disease alongside some accompanying iron deficiency with mcv in high   s and low iron levels  due to constipation  opted to continue her multivitamin with low level iron at discharge with no additional supplements  hct has been been slowly trending down  likely secondary to supratherapeutic inr following coumadin  causing intermittent episodes of blood tinged sputum and occult blood positive stools   with shift of care to symptom manangement  will need to discuss with

 mr    is a    year old male with extensive history of vascular disease presenting for elective carotid artery stenting complicated by periprocedural hypotension and ischemic ecg changes  requiring intra aortic balloon pump  iabp    he was weaned from the balloon pump was kept on nitro and heparin in the ccu and  underwent cabg  see surgical course below   he did retrospectively note that he has been having anginal symptoms the past few weeks with increasing frequency   had never had a cardiac cath before his carotid procedure but when he became acutely hypotensive during the procedure  his coronaries were looked at and they found diffuse disease  not candidate for pci given disease severity  he had a severe       proximal lad lesion  most amenable to cabg   ct   was consulted for possible cabg and felt it was appropriate with plan for cabg on     an iabp was placed in the cath lab while hypotensive given the severity of his lad lesion so that they would try to augment coronary blood flow and assist with decreasing oxygen demand in cardiac tissues   this was discontinued the following day   once his head ct was negative for an intracranial hemorrhage  he was started on a heparin drip for the lad lesion   on hd   he had chest pain and t wave inversions on ekg so nitro drip was started and he became chest pain free   rpt ekg showed normalization of inversions  also continued aspirin     mg daily  atorvastatin    mg daily  and metoprolol      mg daily   he was also continued on plavix    mg daily after loading with     mg in the lab for the carotid stent   he went for cabg on   and transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery service    was potentially vagally mediated given manipulation of the carotid body during procedure as well as groin sheath placement   additionally  was on nitro gtt before the procedure due to blood pressure of    s    s upon presentation from the   facility   when he became hypotensive in the lab  he was started on pressors and the nitro drip was discontinued   he was weaned off pressors   of note  he did take midodrine at home for baseline low blood pressures   on hd    hid iabp was removed and his pressures remained stable   principle reason for admission was for elective carotid artery stenting   this was performed in the cath lab on   and was successful   complications immediately post procedure as above   he was also continued on plavix    mg daily after loading with     mg in the lab for the carotid stent   originially after the carotid procedure  patient arrived to the ccu with word finding difficulty suggestive of wernicke s aphasia with upper motor neuron signs in the right lower extremity   he underwent a ct head which was negative for a bleeding stroke   neurology was consulted and they recommended avoiding sharp decreases in his blood pressure   they recommended sbp    s and mentioned that getting further imaging would help diagnose the cause of his new deficit but would not really change management   he did not get any further imaging   it is possible that he had a global hypoperfusion and watershed area affected by the hypotension experienced during his carotid procedure   also possible that all these symptoms were due to sedation used for the procedure  either way  his mental status improved and final ct scan read was not concerning for acute thrombotic event    he has very severe pvd  now stented greater than    times  see past medical history  was continued on aspirin and plavix as above   the patient was brought to the operating room on   where the patient underwent

her creatinine continued to increase  and uop decreased  the renal team was consulted and she was transferred in the ccu  her uop continued to be poor on lasix drip as she continued to be more fluid overloaded  only able to diurese about a liter during her ccu stay  given her worsening kidney function and heart failure  a family meeting was held to discuss goals of care  the patient s wishes

continued to refuse po medications intermittently  even when she was ablet to take them  her blood pressure would rarely go below      as her kidney function worsened  it was clear that her volume
